# Policy — GitHub Review

Canonical policy entrypoint for `github-pr-review`, independent of the
specific runbook in use (see
[`../runbooks/passive-pr-review.md`](../runbooks/passive-pr-review.md) and
[`../runbooks/active-pr-review.md`](../runbooks/active-pr-review.md)).
Builds on the shared
[`review-scope.md`](../shared/policies/review-scope.md),
[`severity.md`](../shared/policies/severity.md), and
[`evidence.md`](../shared/policies/evidence.md) policies. This file
owns the top-level review lifecycle, the ordering of major policy gates,
and cross-cutting invariants; each concern's normative rule lives in
exactly one canonical sub-policy, referenced below — this file does not
duplicate that prose.

## Canonical sub-policies, in authoritative order

```text
review-authority.md         identity, self-review mutation boundary, publication capability
        ↓
review-action-authorization.md  review analysis vs. GitHub mutation authority;
                            single canonical publication mode (PASSIVE|SEMI|
                            ACTIVE); an explicit ACTIVE request is its own
                            authorization; reviewer independence; fail closed
        ↓
reviewer-delta-review.md    delta re-review vs. normal review mode
        ↓
stateful-delta-rereview.md  eligibility for reconciling prior finding/lifecycle
                            state; #64 change-class reconciliation, blast
                            radius, settled assumptions, escalation
        ↓
stacked-pr-review.md       stack topology detection; effective review base;
                            owned vs. inherited delta; safe-failure fallback;
                            #119 lower-layer re-review trigger
        ↓
pr-scope.md                 complete PR scope, pagination, prior-review awareness
        ↓
repository-checkout.md      optional isolated temporary checkout for richer
                            Repository Context; read-only; guaranteed cleanup
        ↓
review-base-policy.md       (shared) repository-relative review-base policy
                            compliance, once repository-instruction discovery
                            has run; one blocking P0 before implementation
                            findings when the resolved root reliably violates
                            repository policy; fail-closed otherwise; #134
        ↓
review-context.md           optional supplied context (Jira / Issue / HLD / ADR /
                            plan / PR description); scope-boundary reasoning
        ↓
review-evidence.md          prior reviews/comments as Existing Review Evidence;
                            settled vs. speculative; no blind inheritance
        ↓
review-reasoning.md         semantic implication, null-like absence risk,
                            logical cohorts, root-cause consolidation,
                            remediation-scope boundary, architectural
                            placement, code impact / dependency analysis,
                            affected-test impact, api / contract
                            compatibility, dependency / supply-chain
                            deepening
        ↓
parallel-review.md          optional parallel workers per review dimension;
                            execution optimisation only; centralized aggregation
        ↓
finding-placement.md        inline vs. body placement, one representation per finding
        ↓
review-output.md            analysis/publication boundary, batching, decision
        ↓
reviewer-brief.md            private caller-facing Reviewer Brief; never
                            published; composed only from the finalized
                            analysis result above
        ↓
structured-output.md        optional machine-readable review result (same
                            schema as local review); PR head SHA + decision
                            populated; caller-only, never published; not the
                            commit status below
        ↓
review-status-enforcement.md  optional exact-HEAD machine-readable status;
                            blocking vs. positive authority; enforcement
                            detection; explicit opt-in required-check setup
```

This order is the authoritative dependency order: a later file's rules
assume every earlier file's gates have already resolved for this
invocation. [`review-authority.md`](review-authority.md) resolves first
and is never bypassed by anything downstream;
[`review-action-authorization.md`](review-action-authorization.md) builds
directly on it — it separates review analysis from GitHub mutation
authority, defaults to a non-mutating (`PASSIVE`) result, and requires an
explicit `ACTIVE` request (itself sufficient authorization) plus reviewer
independence before any `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` is submitted; its
gate is enforced at submission time in
[`review-output.md`](review-output.md), "Review-action authorization
gate."
[`reviewer-delta-review.md`](reviewer-delta-review.md) explicitly runs
after the self-review mutation-boundary check, and applies to a
self-review exactly as to an external review;
[`stateful-delta-rereview.md`](stateful-delta-rereview.md) runs
immediately after `reviewer-delta-review.md` has resolved the delta
boundary, and governs only whether/how prior finding and lifecycle state
is reconciled within that boundary — it never changes the boundary
itself and never runs when no delta boundary was selected;
[`stacked-pr-review.md`](stacked-pr-review.md) runs next and resolves
whether the PR's declared base is the repository's default/target branch
(the ordinary, non-stacked case, which is a no-op for everything
downstream) or another open PR (a stack layer) — when the latter, it
derives the effective review base that [`pr-scope.md`](pr-scope.md) and
[`repository-checkout.md`](repository-checkout.md) use in place of the
root for scope retrieval and base/head fidelity, never widening the
Review Target;
[`repository-checkout.md`](repository-checkout.md) is optional, runs after
[`pr-scope.md`](pr-scope.md) has established the PR's base/head, and never
changes the Review Target — the PR delta;
[`review-base-policy.md`](../shared/policies/review-base-policy.md)
runs once `stacked-pr-review.md` has resolved topology **and**
repository-instruction discovery has run (the source for that shared
policy's explicit-statement resolution signal), and checks the resolved
root (never an intermediate stack layer's parent-PR base) against the
repository-resolved review base — a shared, cross-Skill policy this file
references, not redefines; it never runs when that root cannot be
reliably resolved;
[`review-context.md`](review-context.md) and
[`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md) are optional and run after
review-authority and reviewer-mode resolution, informing but never widening
the scope [`pr-scope.md`](pr-scope.md) establishes;
[`review-reasoning.md`](review-reasoning.md) explicitly reasons only once
review-authority and reviewer-mode resolution have already run; and
[`parallel-review.md`](parallel-review.md) is an optional execution
optimisation whose sequential and parallel forms must reach the same
findings and decision, bounded by the `spawn_agent` capability gate in
[`agent-delegation.md`](../shared/policies/agent-delegation.md)
(absent by default, hard budgets on agent count/depth, read-only workers
unless separately delegated);
[`reviewer-brief.md`](reviewer-brief.md) runs only after
[`review-output.md`](review-output.md) has finalized findings, severity,
coverage, and verdict — it reads that finalized result and never
influences it, and its output is never one of the inputs
[`review-output.md`](review-output.md), "Batched review construction and
submission," uses to construct the published review;
[`review-status-enforcement.md`](review-status-enforcement.md) is optional
and runs last — only after the verdict, HEAD revalidation, and the
review-action authorization gate in
[`review-output.md`](review-output.md) have resolved — and adds nothing
to the verdict or to native-event authority; its publication is placed
before the final human-facing summary comment so that
`final review comment == last publication event`
([`review-output.md`](review-output.md), "Submission ordering"). See each
file for its own cross-references; this list is not restated per-section
elsewhere. The shared semantics behind the
optional context files live in
[`review-context.md`](../shared/policies/review-context.md) and
[`review-evidence.md`](../shared/policies/review-evidence.md), and the
portable parallel contract in
[`parallel-review.md`](../shared/policies/parallel-review.md) and
the agent-spawn capability boundary in
[`agent-delegation.md`](../shared/policies/agent-delegation.md);
`local-code-review` applies the same shared context model.

## Authoritative PR HEAD

The exact PR HEAD SHA under review must be recorded at the start of
review. Any final decision must apply to that same SHA — see
[`review-output.md`](review-output.md), "HEAD revalidation."

## Review reasoning flow

Once [`review-authority.md`](review-authority.md) and
[`reviewer-delta-review.md`](reviewer-delta-review.md) resolve for this
invocation, review reasoning proceeds:

```text
PR intent → diff → logical cohorts → impacted dependency surface → findings
```

The diff remains the starting point of review, but not necessarily the
complete reasoning boundary — see
[`review-reasoning.md`](review-reasoning.md). For a delta re-review, this
reasoning flow applies to the reviewed delta and any surrounding context
required to validate it, per
[`reviewer-delta-review.md`](reviewer-delta-review.md), "Same reviewer:
delta boundary and scope"; it does not change the delta boundary itself.

## GitHub integration contract

Use an available authenticated GitHub integration when it can retrieve the
complete required state and perform the permitted publication action. If it
cannot, use another supported GitHub API or CLI mechanism. When no available
mechanism can establish complete state, degrade honestly to the supported
passive or `REVIEW INCOMPLETE` behavior.

Concrete tools are implementations of this capability contract, not canonical
requirements. For example, when GitHub CLI is the available integration,
final decisions may use `gh pr review --approve` /
`gh pr review --request-changes`, and line-specific comments may use `gh api`.
Equivalent authenticated integrations are valid. Do not hardcode one API
version when the available integration supports a current equivalent.
