# Policy — PR Scope

Governs complete PR scope retrieval, pagination, and awareness of prior
review activity for `github-pr-review`. Canonical index:
[`github-review.md`](github-review.md). Distinct from the shared,
technology-neutral
[`review-scope.md`](../shared/policies/review-scope.md) policy
(what any Code Review Skill examines) — this file adds only what is
specific to retrieving that scope from GitHub.

## Complete PR scope and pagination

When [`stacked-pr-review.md`](stacked-pr-review.md) has resolved this PR
as a stack layer, "the base" throughout this section means the
**effective review base** that policy derives (the immediate parent PR's
current head) — never the repository's default/target branch. This
changes nothing about the pagination/completeness discipline below; it
only changes which SHA the diff/scope is computed against.

Never assume one API/CLI response contains the complete PR. Follow pagination
to exhaustion for changed files and for every collection used to establish
review state or deduplication, including reviews, review comments, issue
comments, commits, and relevant checks/statuses. Prefer page sizes up to the
documented maximum, but use response pagination metadata rather than a short
page guess where available.

Compare the retrieved changed-file total with authoritative PR metadata when
available. GitHub's REST changed-files endpoint is paginated and returns at
most 3,000 files. If the authoritative count exceeds an API cap, pages cannot
be exhausted, or totals disagree, obtain the complete name/status set from
repository Git data (base...reviewed HEAD) when available. Otherwise return
`REVIEW INCOMPLETE`; never approve or claim the full PR was reviewed.

Treat per-file API patches and aggregate diff media as potentially absent or
truncated. Fall back to fetching the exact base and reviewed HEAD and computing
the diff locally, or retrieve exact file blobs/diffs individually. Validate
that every changed path has an inspectable representation or an explicit
binary/opaque limitation under
[`../shared/policies/file-reviewability.md`](../shared/policies/file-reviewability.md).
If material scope remains unavailable, report what is missing, publish no
formal Approve/Request Changes decision, and do not lower review standards or
sample arbitrary files.

## Existing review awareness

Before publishing an active review, retrieve all relevant paginated reviews,
review comments, and issue comments from the authenticated reviewer/workflow.
Do not suppress another human reviewer's independent feedback merely because
it is similar.

### Retrieving prior review activity

Retrieve, following pagination metadata to exhaustion exactly as for changed
files ("Complete PR scope and pagination" above), every surface that carries
prior review signal for this PR:

- **submitted reviews** — each review's state (`APPROVED`,
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, or dismissed) and its body;
- **inline review comments** — the diff-anchored comments and their reply
  threads;
- **issue / conversation comments** — the PR's non-inline discussion;
- **review threads** — their comments and, where GitHub exposes it, each
  thread's resolved / unresolved state.

If any of these collections cannot be retrieved completely, report
review-history uncertainty (below, and
[`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md)) rather than asserting complete
deduplication or idempotency. Incomplete history never blocks the review of
the current PR — it constrains only what may be claimed about deduplication.

**Integration examples — not canonical requirements.** These implement the
capability contract in [`github-review.md`](github-review.md), "GitHub
integration contract"; any equivalent authenticated GitHub integration that
returns the same review, comment, and thread data is valid, and this Skill
is not bound to `gh`:

```text
gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews
gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments
gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments
```

(`issue_number` is the PR number.) Those REST endpoints do not expose review-
thread resolution state; where it is needed, a GraphQL query over
`repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads` (`isResolved`, plus each thread's
`comments`) supplies it. Absent any resolved-state source, treat threads as
unknown-resolution and reconcile each against the current PR HEAD anyway.

### Interpreting what was retrieved

Classify each relevant item as Existing Review Evidence per
[`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md) and the shared
[`review-evidence.md`](../shared/policies/review-evidence.md). In
particular: a thread's `resolved` flag is evidence of a past conclusion, not
proof the current HEAD is correct (a resolved thread whose defect the current
HEAD reintroduces is a still-relevant finding); automation-authored comments
contribute observations only and never by themselves settle a decision; and a
changed HEAD forces every prior human finding to be re-classified against the
new state.

For each candidate finding, compute a deterministic internal identity from
the PR HEAD SHA, normalized file path, relevant side and line/range (or a
stable cross-cutting location), severity, and normalized finding title or
category. The file path and line/range component is the finding's
**canonical semantic fix/action location** where one is resolved — the
place the repository must change to resolve the finding, per
[`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
"Fix/action location, evidence location, publication" — never the
eventual GitHub publication anchor. An inline→review-body switch, a
GitHub API rejection, or a diff limitation therefore does not change a
finding's identity. When the fix/action location is unresolved, use the
best-known (evidence-scoped) coordinate marked as unresolved, so identity
stays deterministic yet is never matched as equal to a resolved
fix/action location at the same coordinate; the evidence location is not
reclassified as a fix/action location. Human-facing `F1`, `F2`, ...
display IDs remain separate; a hash or serialized identity need not be
exposed. When the same workflow already published the same identity for
the same PR and HEAD, do not publish the finding again, though it may
still appear in returned reasoning. If complete prior activity cannot be
retrieved, report deduplication uncertainty rather than asserting
idempotency.

A changed HEAD starts a new authoritative review state. Prior findings may
inform investigation, but they are neither automatically resolved nor
automatically applicable. Retrieve and review the complete new state; an old
approval or duplicate identity never authorizes the new HEAD.
