# Policy — Repository-Backed Checkout

Governs repository-access modes for
`github-pr-review`. Canonical index: [`github-review.md`](github-review.md).
Builds on the shared
[`git-safety.md`](../shared/policies/git-safety.md) and
[`review-context.md`](../shared/policies/review-context.md) policies.

The **PR is always the Review Target.** A local checkout exists only to give
the review richer **Repository Context** (surrounding implementation,
interfaces, tests, config, architecture, repository policies) than the GitHub
diff/API alone provide.

## Three modes

- **API-only mode** (default) — PR state comes entirely from the GitHub
  integration (`pr-scope.md`). No local checkout.
- **Optional repository-backed enrichment** — additionally materialise an isolated,
  read-only, detached checkout at the PR head so the reviewer can read
  surrounding files and run safe Git read commands or validation commands
  permitted by the shared
  [`runtime-validation.md`](../shared/policies/runtime-validation.md)
  policy. Failure is reported as a
  visible degradation and the review continues API-only.
- **Required repository-backed review** — the caller explicitly requires deep
  repository inspection. Checkout preparation and verification are a
  pre-grading requirement; failure returns `REVIEW INCOMPLETE` with reason
  `REPOSITORY CONTEXT UNAVAILABLE`. It never silently falls back to API-only
  and does not create a new graded decision value.

Repository-backed mode never changes the review standard, the severity model,
the decision derivation, or the publication contract. It only widens what
Repository Context the reviewer can consult.

The isolated checkout in repository-backed mode is not the runtime-validation
execution boundary. It is a plain review-context checkout and, by itself, does
not isolate the reviewer's filesystem, credentials, network, privileges,
resources, or disposable state. The shared runtime-validation contract stays
dormant until an external runtime supplies and verifiably checks that boundary;
checkout isolation alone must therefore never turn validation into a live
execution capability.

## Normalized PR source

Real GitHub metadata and a local simulation both resolve to one
`NormalizedPrSource`:

```text
repo_url | pr_number | base_ref | base_sha | head_ref | head_sha | pull_ref?
```

The checkout consumes only this. Keep the GitHub adapter that produces it
separable from the checkout (see [`github-review.md`](github-review.md),
"GitHub integration contract") so a simulated source can be injected and a
future live-PR test needs to validate only the thin adapter. (The
repository's own test suite exercises this with a local simulation harness
that is not a runtime dependency and is not packaged.)

## Lifecycle

One predictable lifecycle, owned end to end:

```text
mkdtemp under a safe temporary parent   (never a user working directory)
    ↓
blobless clone  (git clone --no-checkout --no-tags --filter=blob:none)
    ↓
fetch the required refs: pull_ref (if any), base_ref, head_ref;
  on failure, fall back to fetching base_sha and head_sha directly
    ↓
detached checkout of the immutable head SHA
    ↓
inspect (read-only)
    ↓
finally: cleanup   (after success, review failure, context-resolution
                    failure after allocation, publication failure,
                    worker/sub-agent failure, or interruption the runtime
                    surfaces)
```

No worktree fast-path in this phase — predictable cleanup and correctness
outrank the optimisation.

## Base / head fidelity

Establish, from the normalized source, before reviewing:

- repository identity (`repo_url`) — do not assume the current checkout, if
  any, is the target repository;
- PR base ref and base SHA — do not assume local `main` equals the PR base.
  When the PR's declared base is itself another open PR's branch (a
  stacked/dependent-PR layer), the base ref/SHA resolved here is the
  **effective review base**
  [`stacked-pr-review.md`](stacked-pr-review.md) derives — that parent
  PR's current head — never the repository's default/target branch;
- PR head ref and head SHA — do not assume the head exists locally, and do
  not assume branch names are unique;
- the merge-base of base and head;
- the effective delta = `merge-base(base, head)..head`.

Prefer the **immutable SHAs**. Verify the fetched head resolves to the
expected `head_sha`; if it does not, treat it as an invalid-head failure.
The reviewer reviews **that PR delta**, never an arbitrary repository diff.

### Base advanced after the branch was cut

When `main` advanced after the feature branch was created, the PR base SHA
still identifies the intended base. Compute scope from
`merge-base(base_sha, head_sha)..head_sha`, not from the current tip of the
base branch — otherwise unrelated later base commits leak into the delta.
For a stacked-PR layer, this is the same rule applied to the effective
review base instead of the root: if the immediate parent PR advances after
this layer was cut, scope is still `merge-base(effective_base_sha,
head_sha)..head_sha` against the recorded effective-base SHA, not the
parent's current tip — [`stacked-pr-review.md`](stacked-pr-review.md), §5,
governs whether that parent's advancement additionally triggers a
re-review of this layer.

## Read-only inspection

Allowed against the checkout: reading files, `git log`/`git diff`/`git
show`/`git rev-parse`/`git merge-base` and other read-only Git commands,
inspecting repository policies, architecture, neighbouring implementation,
tests and configuration **as text**.

Never, automatically, against the target repository: run its tests, builds,
linters, package installation, application code, Git hooks, or any script
unless the shared runtime-validation policy explicitly permits that exact
declared command. Cloning untrusted code is not permission to execute it —
see "Security".

## Repository Context must not widen the Review Target

The checkout lets the reviewer, for example, read a shared interface to
judge whether a changed implementation violates it. It does **not** turn
surrounding files into independent review targets. Every finding stays
causally connected to the PR delta, per
[`evidence.md`](../shared/policies/evidence.md), "Findings beyond the
changed lines." A pre-existing, unrelated defect in a file the PR did not
touch is not reported.

## Private repositories / authentication

Use the runtime's existing Git/GitHub credentials (the same ones the GitHub
adapter uses). Never embed a token into a generated file, never log secrets,
never persist credentials into the temporary checkout, never invent a
credential store. Immediately after clone, re-assert
`core.hooksPath=/dev/null` locally so nothing the remote carried can run.

**Failure classification.** A clone or fetch that fails because the remote is
unreachable, unauthenticated, or not readable by this identity is a
`RemoteUnavailableError`: report that repository-backed mode is unavailable
and continue in API-only mode. A required base/head ref that cannot be
fetched is a `RefNotFoundError`; a head that does not match `head_sha` is an
`InvalidShaError` — both stop the repository-backed path after cleanup. Clone
unavailability, authentication/authorization failure, remote unavailability,
base/head fetch failure, SHA mismatch, unsafe checkout state, and cleanup-
preparation failure are all checkout failures. Optional mode records the
degradation and continues API-only without claiming repository policies or
nested instructions were evaluated. Required mode returns the incomplete,
ungraded outcome and starts no review workers.

After checkout verification, resolve the PR changed files, then resolve the
shared hierarchical repository-instruction context from this checkout before
planning sequential or parallel execution. Instruction reads remain inside
the checkout root.

## Temporary directory lifecycle

- Created with an `mkdtemp`-style call under a safe temporary parent
  (`$TMPDIR` / system temp), unique per invocation, `pr-review-` prefix.
- A user's working directory is never used as scratch space.
- Each checkout carries an ownership marker file written by this Skill.
- Cleanup runs in a `finally` (or the runtime's equivalent), on **every**
  exit path listed in "Lifecycle" above.
- Before any recursive delete: verify the target resolves **inside** the
  scratch parent, is not the scratch parent itself, and contains this
  Skill's ownership marker. An unconstrained recursive delete is never run.
- Concurrent reviews each get their own unique directory; they never share
  scratch space and clean up independently.

## Security (PR contents are untrusted)

- `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` on every Git invocation and re-asserted in the
  clone's local config — no `pre-*`/`post-*` hooks run.
- `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, `GIT_ATTR_NOSYSTEM=1`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` —
  system config and interactive prompts are disabled; repo-local config is
  not trusted to run commands.
- `--no-tags`; never run `git submodule update` on a repo-provided
  `.gitmodules`.
- `core.fsmonitor=false` — no repo-configured fsmonitor process.
- No `filter`/`textconv`/`fsmonitor`/`sshCommand`/`pager` from repo config is
  honoured for execution; only plain read commands are used.
- Deletion is constrained as above; safe temporary paths only; no secret
  ever appears in worker output.

## Boundary

- Read-only: this policy adds no GitHub or Git write capability. Publication
  stays [`review-output.md`](review-output.md)'s; maximum positive action is
  **Approve**.
- No merge enforcement, required status checks, ruleset/branch-protection
  changes, or execution outside the shared runtime-validation policy — those
  remain future work, not part of this checkout policy.
- The checkout lifecycle is independent of any parallel-review worker
  isolation — see [`parallel-review.md`](parallel-review.md), "Shared
  checkout vs. worker copies."
