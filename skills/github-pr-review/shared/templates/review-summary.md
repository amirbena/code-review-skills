# Shared Template — Human-Facing Review Summary

The canonical shape of the **human-facing review body**, shared by both
Skills: `local-code-review`'s own `templates/local-review-report.md` and
`github-pr-review`'s own `templates/external-review-summary.md`. Each
Skill renders this shape for its own delivery surface — a returned
report vs. a published GitHub review body — but the section order and
hierarchy do not diverge, so both Skills read as two delivery modes of
the same Code Review Agent standard.

This is the primary output. It is written for the engineer receiving the
review, not for an orchestrator consuming machine state — see "Machine
metadata is subordinate" below.

## Canonical shape

```markdown
## Code Review

**Result: <emoji> <short human result label>**

<one or two sentences: overall assessment, merge/proceed safety, and the most
important concern or attention point; include scope only when useful>

### What changed
<concise, concrete summary of what the change implements and its intent>

### What was done well
- **<theme>:** <concrete, evidence-backed strength>
- **<theme>:** <concrete, evidence-backed strength>

### Findings
<only when findings exist; for each finding: either its full rendering (per
  [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Canonical full rendering") when this is
  its one authoritative location, or its summary-pointer rendering (per
  [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Canonical summary-pointer rendering") when
  its full form was already published at another location (e.g. a GitHub
  inline comment) — never both. Findings use the compact, field-oriented
  contract in [`finding.md`](finding.md) — a scannable block per finding,
  not a multi-paragraph essay; a longer `Details` field only for the
  cases [`finding.md`](finding.md), "When a longer explanation is
  justified" allows.

### Requirement coverage
<only when an authoritative task contract activates
  [`requirement-coverage.md`](../policies/requirement-coverage.md): overall
  `complete` / `incomplete`, followed by every requirement's identifier,
  status, source citation, concrete evidence, and explanation>

### Validation
- <one entry per selected command, or an explicit no-command entry, using
  exactly `executed`, `skipped`, `failed`, or `unavailable`; include the exact
  command, declaration source, scope/justification, observed evidence, a
  reason where applicable, and — when executed or failed — its `sandbox` /
  `trusted-host` / `host` provenance (a `trusted-host` entry states explicit
  user authorization and absent sandbox isolation; a `host` entry states the
  repository test command ran on the host by default, without sandbox
  isolation)>
- <one entry per attempted targeted per-finding validation: the targeted
  finding id, the `executed` / `failed` / `skipped` / `unavailable` outcome
  with the same provenance dimension when executed or failed,
  the resulting finding validation state, and bounded run evidence; a
  disproving run is recorded here even though it raises no finding>

### Decision
**<decision label>**

<one-sentence rationale tied to the findings above>
```

### Heading is a per-Skill override point

The `## Code Review` line above is this shared shape's **default**
heading — the exact value `local-code-review` renders unchanged in its
own `templates/local-review-report.md` (not linked from here: this
shared template is packaged standalone into every consuming Skill's own
archive, and must never depend on another Skill's directory existing
alongside it — see [`finding-rendering.md`](finding-rendering.md),
"Location source annotation" for the same packaging constraint). A
consuming Skill may override **only this one heading line** for its own
delivery surface, without forking any other part of this shape:
`github-pr-review` overrides it to `## Review Summary` in its own
`templates/external-review-summary.md`, consistently for every rendered
case (clean, findings, fallback, and the self-review informational
`COMMENT`) and for both the structured and the `human_review_output`
senior-voice rendering below. This is the **only** override point this
shared shape defines — every other section, its order, and its content
rules stay identical across both Skills. A Skill that declares no
override renders the default heading shown above; this paragraph is
additive documentation and changes no Skill's rendered output by itself.

## Section rules

- **Result** — states the outcome in plain language immediately, e.g.
  `✅ Review Clean` or `⚠️ Changes Requested`. A reader must never have to
  infer the outcome from counts. **Result and Decision render the same
  single, already-finalized decision value** — per
  [`severity.md`](../policies/severity.md), "Decision derivation
  (mechanical)," that value is derived exactly once, after findings are
  finalized, and both sections present it; neither is a second,
  independently-derived outcome. A published report contains exactly one
  such value throughout — never a Result that disagrees with the Decision
  section, never a provisional Result later replaced by a corrected one,
  and never correction prose narrating that an earlier rendering was
  wrong.
- **Opening assessment** — immediately says whether the change is safe to
  merge/proceed and names the highest-priority concern or reviewer attention
  point. Avoid mechanical “reviewed N files” boilerplate when it adds no
  useful context.
- **What changed** — a concrete implementation summary, not a diff dump.
- **What was done well** — only concrete, evidence-backed strengths.
  Omit the section (or keep it to one line) rather than invent generic
  praise when nothing specific stands out.
- **Empty sections** — omit optional sections that add no information. A clean
  review normally needs only the result/opening assessment, a compact change
  summary when useful, validation, and the final decision; do not repeat “no
  findings” in multiple sections.
- **Findings** — the aggregate view. Every P0/P1/P2 finding is
  represented exactly once, in exactly one authoritative form (full or
  summary-pointer — never both), per
  [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Rules," and rendered with the compact,
  field-oriented finding contract in [`finding.md`](finding.md) so the
  per-finding shape and this summary read as one coherent contract. This
  section does not repeat implementation detail already covered under
  "What changed." Omit the section completely on a clean review; the opening
  assessment and Decision already communicate that result.
- **Validation** — reports only what was actually observed (tests run,
  packaging performed, links checked, etc.). Runtime validation uses the
  shared [`runtime-validation.md`](../policies/runtime-validation.md)
  contract: every selected command is explicitly `executed`, `skipped`,
  `failed`, or `unavailable`, with exact command and reason/evidence;
  non-execution is never a pass. An `executed` or `failed` entry also
  carries its execution **provenance** — `sandbox`, `trusted-host`, or
  `host` — per [`trusted-host-execution.md`](../policies/trusted-host-execution.md);
  a `trusted-host` entry additionally states plainly that the command ran
  on the reviewer's own host under explicit user authorization with no
  sandbox isolation, and a `host` entry that a repository test command ran
  on the reviewer's own host by default, with no sandbox isolation. None
  is ever presented as sandboxed. A **targeted per-finding** validation is
  recorded here too — the targeted finding id, the same
  `executed` / `failed` / `skipped` / `unavailable` outcome (with the
  same provenance dimension when executed or failed), and the
  resulting finding validation state (`runtime-confirmed` /
  `attempted-inconclusive`, or a disproving run that raised no finding).
  Targeted validation state never changes a finding's severity or the
  Decision. It rolls up, together with any contextual-evidence provenance,
  into the finding's single `confidence` value per
  [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Confidence and evidence state" — which is
  likewise presentation/provenance only and never changes severity or the
  Decision.
- **Requirement coverage** — conditional and distinct from Findings. It is
  absent when no authoritative task contract was supplied. When present it
  follows [`requirement-coverage.md`](../policies/requirement-coverage.md),
  appears before Validation, and never changes severity or Decision. It is a
  semantic invariant across findings, clean, structured, and human-style
  renderings: presentation may be condensed, but no active coverage result or
  requirement may be discarded.
- **Decision** — an unambiguous label plus one sentence tying it to the
  findings. Never leave the reader to compute the outcome from raw P0/P1/P2
  counts. The decision itself is derived mechanically from blocking
  severities per [`severity.md`](../policies/severity.md), "Decision
  derivation (mechanical)" — it is never an independent judgment call
  that can contradict that derivation, and a non-blocking finding (P2)
  never produces a blocking decision no matter how strongly it is
  recommended. When coverage is `incomplete` per
  [`review-stopping-criteria.md`](../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md),
  this label and the matching Result render the incomplete/ungraded
  outcome instead — the one case where the primary body's outcome is not
  the plain clean/blocking derivation above.

## Concise human-style summary (opt-in)

When the invocation selects `human_review_output` (per
[`../policies/invocation-options.md`](../policies/invocation-options.md),
"`human_review_output` phrasings"), the **final human-facing summary** is
rendered in a concise senior-engineer voice **instead of** the structured
canonical shape above. Everything upstream is unchanged: the same
investigation, the same evidence-backed findings, the same P0/P1/P2
severities, the same mechanically derived decision, and — for
`github-pr-review` — the same GitHub review state, the same set of inline
findings at the same locations, and the same optional machine-readable
status. Only the wording of this final summary differs (and, where a
Skill also publishes inline review findings, the wording of those when
the companion option `human_inline_findings` is on — see "Companion
inline rendering (`human_inline_findings`)" below).

The concise form reads like a short review note a strong engineer would
leave by hand. Its **voice** — how it leads with the defect, separates
required from optional, avoids boilerplate and manufactured praise, and
states each fact once — is owned by
[`finding-rendering.md`](finding-rendering.md), "Senior voice contract";
this section states only the summary's own shape:

- a one- or two-sentence opening that says whether the change is safe to
  merge / proceed and names the single biggest concern;
- **what's good** — specific, evidence-backed praise only, never a
  required slot (see "Senior voice contract", "No dedicated praise
  slot" — omit entirely if nothing specific stands out);
- **what's concerning** / **what to change** — the findings that need
  action, in prose, each still carrying its `P0` / `P1` / `P2` label when
  it is referenced, with any required correction stated directly per
  "Senior voice contract", "Required fixes are stated directly, not as
  first-person suggestions";
- **requirement coverage** — when analysis was active, the overall signal and
  every requirement/status remain visible in concise prose; omit it when
  coverage was inert;
- an apparently intentional trade-off may be raised as a question
  ("was returning `null` to the caller here deliberate?") rather than
  asserted as a defect.

It **excludes** internal review-process language and investigation
metadata entirely — review mode, base/head SHAs, file or finding counts,
action mode, parallel-worker / aggregation wording, and the subordinate
machine-metadata block are all left out of this comment. It does not
restate a finding's full `Evidence` / `Impact` / `Fix` block when that
detail is already published elsewhere (e.g. a GitHub inline comment).

This is presentation only. It never changes finding detection, severity
classification, finding identity or deduplication, re-review semantics,
the blocking / non-blocking decision, or — where a Skill has them — the
GitHub review-state selection and publication ordering. Mode on and mode
off produce identical findings and severities (and, for `github-pr-review`,
identical GitHub review state and machine-readable status), and differ
only in the text of this final summary — and, when `human_inline_findings`
is on, in the wording of the inline findings, which stay the same
findings at the same locations. Requirement-coverage content is likewise
unchanged. When the option is off (the default), the
structured canonical shape above is used unchanged.

### Companion inline rendering (`human_inline_findings`)

`human_review_output` re-voices this summary. Where a Skill also publishes
**inline** review findings (`github-pr-review`), the companion option
`human_inline_findings` re-voices those to match — a short heading that
keeps the `P0` / `P1` / `P2` severity and names the finding, then compact
prose in place of the `Evidence:` / `Impact:` / `Fix:` labelled block
(see [`finding-rendering.md`](finding-rendering.md), "Canonical human
inline rendering") — so
a senior-mode review is coherent end to end. Its default is derived:
`explicit_value ?? human_review_output`, so enabling senior mode enables
it too; it is set explicitly only to opt out (structured inline block
under a concise summary) or to opt in on its own. Same presentation-only
guarantee: the inline findings keep their detection, severity, identity,
deduplication, evidence, remediation, decision, canonical fix/action
location, and publication anchor; only the inline wording changes. See
[`../policies/invocation-options.md`](../policies/invocation-options.md),
"`human_inline_findings` derived default and phrasings".

### Human full rendering for body/fallback findings (`github-pr-review` only)

This subsection is an explicit, opt-in extension that only
`github-pr-review` applies, per its own `policies/review-output.md` and
`templates/external-review-summary.md` (not linked from here for the same
packaging reason as the heading override above). `human_review_output`
selects the human-voiced rendering of the final summary above; for
`github-pr-review` specifically it *also* selects the **human full
rendering** in
[`finding-rendering.md`](finding-rendering.md), "Canonical human full
rendering" for any finding that is rendered in full **in the review
body** rather than as a GitHub inline comment — a passive review's
findings (passive has no inline surface at all), and an active-review
finding with no valid inline anchor. This closes the gap where a finding
published in the body would otherwise stay in the structured
`Evidence:` / `Impact:` / `Fix:` block even while the rest of the review
reads in senior voice.

It is additive documentation, inert for any consumer that does not opt
into it: `local-code-review` does not reference this subsection, has no
inline/body split (every finding is already a body finding), and its own
senior-voice wiring for its report (per its own
`templates/local-review-report.md`, "Concise human-style output
(opt-in)") is unaffected and unchanged.

This is governed directly by `human_review_output`, **not** by
`human_inline_findings` — that companion option stays scoped to the
GitHub inline surface exactly as "Companion inline rendering
(`human_inline_findings`)" above defines it, and is not redefined by this
subsection. A summary-pointer line for a finding already published in
full elsewhere is unaffected by either option — it stays the compact
severity/title/location pointer it is today. Presentation only: the
finding's detection, severity, identity, deduplication, evidence,
remediation, canonical fix/action location, and whether it is placed in
the body or inline are exactly the same whether this rendering is on or
off — only the wording of the body finding's `Evidence` / `Impact` /
`Fix` content changes.

### Density, de-duplication, and voice tightening

This density/de-duplication/no-boilerplate guidance describes the voice
itself, not a GitHub-specific mechanism, so it is owned once, for both
Skills, by [`finding-rendering.md`](finding-rendering.md), "Senior voice
contract", "Density, de-duplication, and voice tightening" — applying to
every senior-voice rendering (inline, full-body, and this summary prose)
for both Skills alike. `local-code-review` inherits it through the same
link this "Concise human-style summary (opt-in)" section already is —
via its own `templates/local-review-report.md`, "Concise human-style
output (opt-in)" — with no separate wiring needed. `github-pr-review`'s
own `policies/review-output.md` and `templates/external-review-summary.md`
apply it identically (not linked from here for the same packaging reason
as the heading override above).

## Machine metadata is subordinate

Internal/orchestration state (reviewed HEAD or base/head SHAs, raw
P0/P1/P2 counts, a normalized machine decision code, internal finding
identifiers, the deterministic `standard` / `elevated` / `deep`
change-risk depth and its activating signals per
[`../policies/change-risk-signals.md`](../policies/change-risk-signals.md),
the fired repository-expansion triggers and rings reached per
[`../policies/repository-expansion.md`](../policies/repository-expansion.md),
the coverage state per
[`../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md`](../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md),
or other automation state) is never part of the primary human-facing body
above. Where publishing it is genuinely useful to a
caller or automation, append it after the human-facing body, clearly
subordinate — always last, always visually secondary to the Result →
... → Decision body above it.

The **one exception to consumer-gating** below is the trio of always-on
process classifications: the change-risk depth per
[`../policies/change-risk-signals.md`](../policies/change-risk-signals.md),
the repository-expansion decisions per
[`../policies/repository-expansion.md`](../policies/repository-expansion.md),
and the coverage state per
[`../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md`](../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md).
All three are always emitted in this subordinate block — on every review,
including a clean `standard` review with no signals, no fired expansion
trigger, and complete coverage. The change-risk depth and
repository-expansion pair render never as a finding and never in a way
that implies a verdict. Every other field stays consumer-gated.

**Coverage is the one field in this block that is not merely
descriptive.** Per
[`review-stopping-criteria.md`](../policies/review-stopping-criteria.md),
"Labeling," an `incomplete` coverage state also overrides what the
primary Result and Decision render: they show the incomplete/ungraded
outcome instead of the clean or blocking value
[`../policies/severity.md`](../policies/severity.md)'s mechanical
derivation would otherwise produce, so that an incomplete review is never
mistaken for a clean one. Findings already gathered are still reported in
full; only the top-level outcome label is affected.

This shared template fixes *that* the metadata is subordinate and
appended last; it does not fix the concrete markup used to render it.
Each consuming Skill's own template owns that choice for its own
delivery surface — see
`local-code-review`'s own `templates/local-review-report.md` (native
Markdown, since its delivery surface is a returned report read directly
in a terminal/chat, where a collapsible section provides no benefit) and
`github-pr-review`'s own `templates/external-review-summary.md` (a
collapsible `<details>` block, since its delivery surface is a rendered
GitHub review body where GitHub natively supports collapsing it). Do not
publish machine metadata merely because it is available — include only
fields with a genuine downstream consumer (orchestration, automated
re-review, audit), plus the always-present change-risk classification
noted above. If nothing else needs it, the block still carries that
classification and nothing more, rather than padding the review with
other unused state.

One field is **conditional on activation rather than consumer-gated**:
whether [`../policies/large-pr-partitioning.md`](../policies/large-pr-partitioning.md)
activated for this change and, when it did, the partitions built and any
cross-partition duplicate/consolidation aggregation found. It is rendered
only when partitioning activated; a change that stayed under that
policy's diff-size threshold carries no partitioning line at all — it is
not part of the always-on pair above, and its absence on an ordinary
review is not an omission.
