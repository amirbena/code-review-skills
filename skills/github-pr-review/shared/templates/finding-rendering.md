# Shared Template — Finding Renderings

The canonical rendering exemplars for a single finding, projected onto each
delivery surface. The **fields and the quality/conciseness contract** these
render are owned by [`finding.md`](finding.md); this file is one projection
of those fields and never changes the finding's identity, severity, evidence
bar, canonical location, or the decision derivation. Read
[`finding.md`](finding.md) first — it is the contract; this file is how that
contract is drawn.

Every `[<severity>]` slot below renders the bare `P0` / `P1` / `P2` code by
default. A Skill that defines the optional severity-legend override in
[`finding.md`](finding.md), "Fields" (`github-pr-review` does, in its own
`policies/review-output.md`) substitutes `[<severity> (<compact
meaning>)]` — e.g. `[P1 (Blocking)]` — everywhere a severity is shown
(full rendering, inline rendering, human inline heading, and
summary-pointer), consistently, with no other change to these shapes,
**only when that Skill's own gating invocation option resolves `true`**
(`github-pr-review`'s is `include_severity_description`, default
`false` — see
[`../policies/invocation-options.md`](../policies/invocation-options.md));
`github-pr-review`'s own default rendering keeps the bare-code form too,
identical in shape to a Skill that declares no legend at all. This is
additive and inert for a Skill that declares no legend
(`local-code-review` does not, and its renderings below stay exactly the
bare-code form regardless of any option's value). Wherever the
parenthetical is shown, it renders inside the same emphasized unit as
the severity and title it accompanies — never as a trailing, separately
emphasized, or unemphasized addition (see each Skill's own
`policies/review-output.md` for the surface-by-surface contract).

## Canonical full rendering

Used wherever a finding needs its complete, standalone representation —
a local review report, or a GitHub review body when no valid inline
anchor exists. Compact and field-oriented:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

A finding that meets "When a longer explanation is justified" and whose
detail-visibility decision is true adds one `Details` field after `Fix`:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
- **Details:** <the cross-file / concurrency / security / invariant
  explanation supporting the finding — a short paragraph, not an essay>
```

When [`../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md`](../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md)
identifies a broader, legitimately separate concern alongside a bounded
required `Fix`, one `Follow-up` line is added after `Fix` (omitted when no
such concern was identified, or when the broader work is itself the
required `Fix`):

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <the smallest correction that restores the current contract>
- **Follow-up:** <the broader, separately-scoped concern, not required in
  this change>
```

When the evidence was observed somewhere other than the resolved
fix/action location, one `Evidence location` line is added directly after
`Location` (omitted when the two coincide):

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<fix/action path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence location:** `<where the evidence was observed>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When a narrow, well-defined defect class applies to the finding, one
`Defect kind` line is added after `Evidence` (and before any `Contextual
evidence` / `Runtime validation` / `Confidence` / `Capability` lines) —
see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Defect classification". It is a
classification, not provenance, and never carries a severity:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Defect kind:** `<kebab-case defect-class slug>`
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When contextual evidence informed the finding and materially explains why
the behavior is incorrect or risky, one `Contextual evidence` line is added
after `Evidence` (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Contextual evidence and
provenance"). It is a provenance record and never carries a severity;
absent on a finding that rests on code evidence alone:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Contextual evidence:** <the requirement / acceptance criterion /
  accepted decision / repository policy / feedback / historical note that
  informed this finding — source and the specific clause>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When a targeted runtime check produced a `runtime-confirmed` or
`attempted-inconclusive` state, one `Runtime validation` line is added after
`Evidence` (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Runtime validation state and
provenance"). The `reasoned` default is never rendered. It is a provenance
record and never carries a severity:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Runtime validation:** runtime-confirmed — <bounded reproduction and its
  pass/fail evidence> _(or)_ attempted-inconclusive — <what was attempted and
  why it did not confirm>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When the finding's `confidence` value is anything other than the `credible`
default **and it is not merely the roll-up of a `Runtime validation` line
already shown** (a `runtime-confirmed` line with `confidence` `confirmed`, or
an `attempted-inconclusive` line with `confidence`
`runtime-validation-unavailable`), one `Confidence` line is added after
`Evidence` (and after any `Runtime validation` line) — see
[`finding.md`](finding.md), "Confidence and evidence state". The `credible`
default is never rendered, and neither is a value a shown `Runtime
validation` line already conveys. It never lowers the evidence bar and never
carries a severity:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Confidence:** confirmed _(or)_ runtime-validation-unavailable _(or)_
  external-contract-unvalidated _(or)_ insufficient-context — <one clause on
  the unresolved basis, when the value is not `confirmed`>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When a domain-specific deepening capability's reasoning contributed the
finding, one `Capability` line is added after `Evidence` (and after any
`Contextual evidence` / `Runtime validation` / `Confidence` lines) — see
[`finding.md`](finding.md), "Capability provenance". It is a provenance
record and never carries a severity; absent on a finding base reasoning
alone already fully supports:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Evidence:** <concrete evidence, concise>
- **Capability:** security-deepening — <one clause on what the deeper
  investigation established beyond base reasoning>
- **Impact:** <concrete engineering consequence, concise>
- **Fix:** <concrete correction direction, not a patch>
```

When the fix/action location is unresolved, no `Evidence location` line
is added; `Location` instead carries the best-known coordinate with the
trailing unresolved annotation (see "Fix/action location, evidence
location, publication"):

```markdown
- **Location:** `<observed path>:<line-or-range>` _(evidence location; fix/action location unresolved)_
```

A **consolidated root-cause finding** adds an `Affected locations` list
directly after `Location` (see "Affected locations on a consolidated
finding"); `Location` is the shared cause:

```markdown
### <id> [<severity>] <short, concrete title>

- **Location:** `<shared-cause path>:<line-or-range>`
- **Affected locations:**
  - `<path>:<line-or-range>` — <how the shared cause reaches this site>
  - `<path>:<line-or-range>` — <how the shared cause reaches this site>
- **Evidence:** <the shared cause, concise>
- **Impact:** <combined engineering consequence across the affected sites>
- **Fix:** <one correction direction at the shared cause / canonical owner>
```

### Location source annotation

When a Skill appends its source-state classification, it goes after the
required `` `<path>:<line-or-range>` `` value on the `Location` line, as a
strict trailing addition — it never replaces, reorders, or hides that
value:

```markdown
- **Location:** `<path>:<line-or-range>` _(<annotation>)_
```

For example, `local-code-review` appends the repository-state category a
finding was attributed to (`(committed)`, `(staged)`, `(unstaged)`, or
`(untracked)`) — see that Skill's own `policies/repository-state.md`,
"Attribution in findings" (not linked from here: this shared template is
packaged standalone into every consuming Skill's own archive, and must
never depend on another Skill's directory existing alongside it). This
concept is specific to a local Git working tree and has no equivalent
for a GitHub Pull Request, whose findings are already anchored to a
specific commit/diff location by GitHub itself — `github-pr-review` is
not required to add one, and must not force repository-state categories
onto PR findings that don't have them. A Skill that has no such concept
simply renders the `Location` line without a trailing annotation.

The `_(evidence location; fix/action location unresolved)_` marker from
"Fix/action location, evidence location, publication" is a second
permitted strict trailing addition on this same line. When both apply,
render the source-state annotation first, then the unresolved marker;
neither replaces, reorders, or hides the `` `<path>:<line-or-range>` ``
value.

## Canonical inline rendering

Used for a GitHub inline review comment, where the platform supplies the
file/line anchor and the comment's own identity. `id` and `Location` are
omitted for that reason; severity stays first; fields stay concise:

```text
[<severity>] <short, concrete title>

Evidence: <concrete evidence — what the code actually does>

Impact: <concrete engineering consequence — why it matters>

Fix: <concrete correction direction, when useful>
```

A justified longer explanation adds a single `Details:` line after `Fix:`, on
the same visibility terms as the full rendering.

When [`../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md`](../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md)
identifies a broader, separately-scoped concern, name it as a distinct
closing sentence inside the `Fix:` prose (e.g. "Separately, ... is a valid
follow-up, not required here") — there is no separate `Follow-up:` line on
this surface. It must stay clearly distinguishable from the required
correction, never phrased as if it were also required now.

The inline anchor is the finding's canonical fix/action location, not the
evidence location and not a line chosen because the platform allows a
comment there (see "Fix/action location, evidence location, publication",
and each Skill's placement policy). When the evidence was observed
elsewhere, name that evidence/source location inside the `Evidence:`
prose — there is no separate `Evidence location:` line on this surface.

When a narrow, well-defined defect class applies to the finding, name it
inside the `Evidence:` prose as well — there is no separate `Defect kind:`
line on this surface (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Defect
classification").

When contextual evidence informed the finding, name it inside the
`Evidence:` prose as well — there is no separate `Contextual evidence:`
line on this surface (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Contextual evidence
and provenance").

When a targeted runtime check produced a `runtime-confirmed` or
`attempted-inconclusive` state, state it inside the `Evidence:` prose too —
there is no separate `Runtime validation:` line on this surface (see
[`finding.md`](finding.md), "Runtime validation state and provenance"). The
`reasoned` default is not mentioned.

When the finding's `confidence` value is not the `credible` default, state it
inside the `Evidence:` prose as well — there is no separate `Confidence:`
line on this surface (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Confidence and
evidence state"). The `credible` default is not mentioned, nor is a value the
prose already conveys through an equivalent `runtime-confirmed` /
`attempted-inconclusive` mention.

When a domain-specific deepening capability contributed the finding, name it
inside the `Evidence:` prose as well — there is no separate `Capability:`
line on this surface (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Capability
provenance"). Omitted whenever no capability contributed.

For a **consolidated root-cause finding**, name the affected call paths
inside the prose — the `Evidence:` block, or a short `Affected call paths:`
list after `Fix:` — so no manifestation site is dropped on this surface.
The anchor stays the shared cause (see "Affected locations on a
consolidated finding").

## Senior voice contract

The **single owner** of the senior/human review voice — the prose rules
shared by every rendering that opts into `human_review_output` /
`human_inline_findings`: "Canonical human inline rendering" and
"Canonical human full rendering" below, and the review-summary prose in
[`review-summary.md`](review-summary.md), "Concise human-style summary
(opt-in)". Those three sites keep only their own surface-specific shape —
what fields exist, where the anchor comes from, what is inline vs.
full-body vs. summary prose — and link here instead of restating the
voice. This is **presentation only**: it changes no finding's detection,
severity, identity, deduplication, evidence/remediation requirement,
verdict derivation, placement/anchor, or publication authorization (see
[`finding.md`](finding.md)).

It reads the way a strong senior engineer would write the comment or
summary by hand — not a structured report with the field labels taken
off.

### Voice principles

1. **Lead with the defect or failure mode.** The heading (or opening
   sentence, in the summary) says what breaks and under what condition.
2. **Say why it matters in the repo's own terms** — the invariant, gate,
   or caller that gets hurt — not generic risk language.
3. **State each fact once.** Restatement is judged semantically, not
   lexically (see "Semantic restatement, not lexical" below): the title,
   evidence, impact, and fix don't repeat each other's substance.
4. **Separate required from optional.** The required correction
   direction is stated plainly; an implementation suggestion is marked
   optional (e.g. "one way: …"), never over-prescribed when several
   fixes would work.
5. **Tone follows severity.** `P0`/`P1` findings are decisive — no
   hedging, no question unless the uncertainty is genuine. `P2` findings
   are proportional, never artificially urgent.
6. **Length follows complexity.** A simple finding is 1–3 sentences.
   Extra explanation only for the existing "longer explanation" exception
   each rendering below defines.
7. **No boilerplate.** Never "The evidence shows…", "The impact of this
   is…", "Consider changing…", or generic praise. Evidence, impact, and
   fix are carried in the prose, never announced by a sentence about
   itself.
8. **Same rigor as structured mode.** Senior voice is not fewer labels,
   longer prose, a friendlier tone, or more explanation — every
   mandatory-core field, the evidence bar, and uncertainty handling stay
   exactly as required.

### No dedicated praise slot

Senior/human output has **no dedicated praise slot**. Positive feedback
appears only when it is specific and materially useful; it is never
manufactured to fill a shape (a "what's good" line, a required opening
compliment, or similar). This matches the structured shape, where "What
was done well" is itself optional and evidence-only — senior voice does
not introduce a senior-only obligation the structured shape doesn't have.

### Required fixes are stated directly, not as first-person suggestions

A **required** correction is stated directly — what must become true —
never as a first-person suggestion (`I'd`, `I would`) or other hedging.
First-person framing is reserved for a genuinely **optional**
implementation suggestion; it is never the default, and never used on a
`P0`/`P1` finding's required fix. This mirrors the existing structured
`Fix` field, which is already declarative even where several
implementations would work — it states the required outcome, not the
reviewer's personally preferred implementation.

### Density, de-duplication, and voice tightening

These rules govern every senior-voice rendering — inline, full-body, and
the review-summary prose — for both Skills; they are not scoped to one
Skill or one surface:

- omit a section entirely when it would add no information, rather than
  rendering it with placeholder or boilerplate content;
- never restate the diff — describe what changed and why, not a
  line-by-line narration of the patch;
- never narrate file-by-file inspection or reproduction mechanics beyond
  what the `Validation` / [`../policies/runtime-validation.md`](../policies/runtime-validation.md)
  contract already records — the reader needs the result, not a
  transcript of the review process;
- never repeat the same evidence in more than one place across the
  summary line, a fallback full finding, and its inline comment — each
  fact appears once, in its one authoritative location;
- let the output's length scale with the number and complexity of
  findings, never with the number of available template sections — a
  two-finding review and a ten-finding review do not carry the same
  fixed scaffolding;
- there is **no numeric word or line cap** — concision comes from cutting
  restatement and process narration, never from truncating evidence,
  impact, or fix;
- read like a concise human review: natural short paragraphs, minimal
  headings, no evidence repeated across sections, and no meta-commentary
  about the review process itself (no "I reviewed file X then file Y",
  no narrating that a reproduction was attempted beyond the Validation /
  runtime-validation record) — while every existing evidence/rigor
  guarantee (the same findings, severities, decision, and anchors) stays
  exactly as specified elsewhere in this shape and in
  [`finding.md`](finding.md).

### Semantic restatement, not lexical

"State each fact once" (principle 3) is judged by whether the prose after
a heading/title adds genuinely **new information** — evidence, the
triggering condition, the consequence, or the correction direction — not
by whether it repeats a noun phrase from the heading. A heading like `P2:
Retry eligibility logic is duplicated` followed by prose that also says
"retry eligibility" and "duplicated" is not a violation if the prose adds
the consequence and the fix. Conversely, a heading like `P1: Authorization
check is broken` followed by "The auth check doesn't work properly and
must be addressed" adds nothing despite sharing no noun phrase with the
heading — that **is** a violation. Judge restatement this way; do not
build or apply a mechanical noun-phrase-repetition check against the
heading.

## Canonical human inline rendering

An **opt-in** projection of the same fields onto a GitHub inline comment,
selected by `human_inline_findings` (see
[`../policies/invocation-options.md`](../policies/invocation-options.md),
"`human_inline_findings` derived default and phrasings" — its default is
derived from `human_review_output`). Used only by `github-pr-review`, and
only for the inline surface: `local-code-review` has no inline comments.
The summary-pointer rendering is never affected by either presentation
option. The full rendering above has its own opt-in human projection —
selected by `human_review_output` directly, not by `human_inline_findings`
— defined next in "Canonical human full rendering." The voice itself —
what makes this read like a senior engineer's comment rather than a
relabelled structured block — is owned by "Senior voice contract" above;
this section states only the inline-surface shape:

```text
<severity>: <short, concrete finding — what is actually wrong>

<one to three short paragraphs that carry the concrete problem and the
evidence for it, the engineering consequence when it is material or
non-obvious, and an actionable correction direction when one is useful.
A genuine open question or trade-off is phrased as a question, not
asserted as a defect.>
```

Examples:

```text
P1: Paginated file listing stops after page 1

`list_files()` reads only the first page, so a large PR can reach a clean
review decision with files that were never seen. Exhaust the pagination
before permitting a clean decision.
```

```text
P2: Sync and async retry paths decide eligibility separately

`should_retry()` in the sync flow and the inline check in
`AsyncRunner.retry` already disagree on 429 handling. Move eligibility
into one helper that both paths call.
```

Rules — this is a re-voicing, not a weaker finding:

- follows the **Senior voice contract** above in full, including no
  dedicated praise slot and no first-person/hedging on a required fix;
- **severity stays visible first**, in the heading, as `P0` / `P1` /
  `P2` (e.g. `P2: …`, never `[P2] …`);
- the **mandatory core still holds** — What / Where / Evidence / Impact /
  Fix per "Finding quality contract". "Where" is the inline anchor the
  surface supplies (the canonical fix/action location, unchanged); the
  other four are carried by the prose instead of by labelled fields, and
  none may be dropped, softened to a vague gesture, or replaced by
  generic "consider improving this" language;
- **no meta-commentary about the review process** — no narrating that a
  file was inspected, that a reproduction was attempted, or restating
  investigation steps; the comment states the result, not the process
  that produced it;
- **evidence-based** per [`../policies/evidence.md`](../policies/evidence.md);
  genuine **uncertainty is preserved** as a question rather than asserted;
- a justified longer explanation ("When a longer explanation is
  justified") is folded into the prose as one extra short paragraph on
  the same visibility terms as `Details` elsewhere — never re-introduced
  as a `Details:` label;
- the finding's **identity, severity, deduplication, canonical
  fix/action location, evidence/detection location, and publication
  anchor are exactly those of the structured inline rendering above** —
  structured and human inline are two renderings of one semantic
  finding, and the choice of rendering never moves the comment off the
  canonical fix/action location or into the review body (that is decided
  only by each Skill's placement policy, independent of voice);
- a **consolidated root-cause finding** still names every affected call
  path in the prose — the re-voicing never drops a manifestation site;
- a **`Follow-up`** identified per
  [`../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md`](../policies/remediation-scope-boundary.md)
  is folded into the closing prose as a clearly separated sentence, never
  phrased as part of the required fix — the re-voicing changes wording
  only, never the underlying remediation-scope-boundary outcome.

## Canonical human full rendering

An **opt-in** projection of the same fields onto a finding rendered **in
full in the review body** rather than as a GitHub inline comment — used by
`github-pr-review` for a passive review's findings (passive has no inline
surface, so every finding is rendered this way) and for an active-review
finding with no valid inline anchor (see each Skill's own placement
policy). Selected directly by `human_review_output` (see
[`../policies/invocation-options.md`](../policies/invocation-options.md),
"`human_review_output` phrasings"), **not** by `human_inline_findings` —
that option is scoped to the GitHub inline surface only and is not
redefined by this section. `local-code-review` has no inline/body split
(every finding is already a body finding); it is unaffected and keeps its
own senior-voice summary wiring exactly as it stands today. The voice
itself is owned by "Senior voice contract" above; this section states
only the full-body-surface shape.

Unlike the inline rendering, this surface has no platform-supplied anchor,
so the finding's `id` and canonical `Location` are kept as their own line,
exactly as in the canonical full rendering; only the `Evidence` /
`Impact` / `Fix` block below them is re-voiced as senior-engineer prose,
the same way "Canonical human inline rendering" re-voices the inline
block:

```text
### <id> <severity>: <short, concrete title>

`<path>:<line-or-range>`

<one to three short paragraphs that carry the concrete problem and the
evidence for it, the engineering consequence when it is material or
non-obvious, and an actionable correction direction when one is useful.
A genuine open question or trade-off is phrased as a question, not
asserted as a defect.>
```

Examples:

```text
### F3 P1: Paginated file listing stops after page 1

`app/github_client.py:88-104`

`list_files()` reads only the first page, so a large PR can reach a clean
review decision with files that were never seen. Exhaust the pagination
before permitting a clean decision.
```

```text
### F2 P2: Sync and async retry paths decide eligibility separately

`app/retry.py:41-58`

`should_retry()` in the sync flow and the inline check in
`AsyncRunner.retry` already disagree on 429 handling. Move eligibility
into one helper that both paths call.
```

This is a re-voicing of the **same finding**, on the same terms as the
human inline rendering:

- follows the **Senior voice contract** above in full, including no
  dedicated praise slot and no first-person/hedging on a required fix;
- **severity stays visible first**, in the heading, next to `id` (e.g.
  `F2 P2: …`, never `[P2] …`);
- **`id` and `Location` stay their own line** — the body has no anchor to
  omit them in favor of, unlike the inline surface;
- the **mandatory What / Where / Evidence / Impact / Fix core** is fully
  present — carried by the prose for the last three, none dropped,
  softened, or replaced by generic language;
- an `evidence location`, `contextual evidence`, `runtime validation`, or
  `confidence` line that the structured full rendering would show is
  folded into the prose instead — the same fold-in treatment the inline
  rendering uses — rather than added as its own labelled line;
- a justified longer explanation folds into the prose as one extra short
  paragraph, on the same visibility terms as `Details` elsewhere, never
  re-introduced as a `Details:` label;
- **no meta-commentary about the review process** and **evidence-based**,
  per [`../policies/evidence.md`](../policies/evidence.md) — the same
  rules as the human inline rendering;
- the finding's **identity, severity, deduplication, canonical
  fix/action location, evidence/detection location, and the fact that it
  is published in the body rather than inline are exactly those of the
  structured full rendering** — structured and human full are two
  renderings of one semantic finding; rendering voice never moves it
  between the body and an inline comment (that is decided only by each
  Skill's placement policy, independent of voice);
- a **consolidated root-cause finding** keeps its `Affected locations`
  list (see "Affected locations on a consolidated finding" in
  [`finding.md`](finding.md)), either as its own line or folded into the
  prose, so no manifestation site is dropped.

When `human_review_output` is off — explicitly, or because nothing set
it — a body finding uses the structured full rendering above, unchanged.

## Canonical summary-pointer rendering

Used when the finding's full representation is published elsewhere (for
example, a GitHub inline comment) and the review body only needs to
reference it — never both in full. The `` `<path>:<line-or-range>` `` is
the canonical fix/action location (or the best-known coordinate with the
unresolved annotation when the fix/action location is unresolved):

```markdown
- **<severity> — <short title>**
  `<path>:<line-or-range>`
```

For a **consolidated root-cause finding** the pointer adds a one-line
affected-locations count or list so the reader still sees the finding
reaches several sites:

```markdown
- **<severity> — <short title>**
  `<shared-cause path>:<line-or-range>` — affects `<path:line>`, `<path:line>`, …
```

## Rules

These are the rendering-specific rules; the finding-field and
quality-contract rules are in [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Rules".

- the opt-in **human inline rendering** (`human_inline_findings`,
  `github-pr-review` inline surface only) re-voices an inline finding as
  senior-engineer prose without `Evidence:` / `Impact:` / `Fix:` labels;
  it keeps the severity in the heading, the full mandatory core, the
  evidence bar, and the finding's identity, severity, deduplication, and
  canonical location — a projection, never a weaker finding (see
  "Canonical human inline rendering");
- the opt-in **human full rendering** (`human_review_output`,
  `github-pr-review` body/fallback surface only) applies the same
  re-voicing to a finding rendered in full in the review body, keeping
  `id` and `Location` as their own line since the body has no
  platform-supplied anchor; it is selected directly by
  `human_review_output`, not by `human_inline_findings`, and is likewise
  a projection, never a weaker finding (see "Canonical human full
  rendering");
- optional fields render only when populated — never as an empty or
  placeholder line (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Optional and
  surface-specific fields");
- the **Confidence** line renders on the full rendering only when the value
  is not the `credible` default and is not already conveyed by a shown
  `Runtime validation` line; on the inline surface it folds into the
  `Evidence:` prose, never as its own line; it never lowers the evidence bar
  and never carries a severity (see [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Confidence
  and evidence state");
- the **Capability** line renders on the full rendering only when a
  domain-specific deepening capability contributed the finding; on the
  inline surface it folds into the `Evidence:` prose, never as its own
  line; it never carries a severity and never changes identity,
  deduplication, or the decision derivation (see [`finding.md`](finding.md),
  "Capability provenance");
- the **Defect kind** line renders on the full rendering only when a
  narrow, well-defined defect class applies to the finding; on the
  inline surface it folds into the `Evidence:` prose, never as its own
  line; it is a classification, never a severity input, and never
  changes identity, deduplication, or the decision derivation (see
  [`finding.md`](finding.md), "Defect classification");
- a finding has exactly one authoritative full representation. If it is
  published in full at one location (e.g. inline), every other location
  uses the summary-pointer form instead of repeating the full finding.
