# Shared Policy — Review Ownership

Applies independently to both Skills.

## Canonical invariant

```text
One review scope → one Code Review Agent owner
```

Examples:

```text
local branch A  → local-code-review owner
PR #42          → github-pr-review owner
```

If a dedicated Code Review Agent is already assigned to the same task,
branch, PR, or implementation scope, do not launch a competing formal
reviewer. Return conceptually:

```text
REVIEW ALREADY OWNED
```

when orchestration context indicates that another Code Review Agent owns
the same scope. The runtime determines how ownership metadata is
exposed; this policy does not hardcode a runtime-specific
ownership-discovery mechanism.

## Access vs. Ownership

Keep these two concepts strictly separate:

- **Repository review access** — can this authenticated GitHub identity
  actually review this PR? (a GitHub-permissions question, governed by
  the `github-pr-review` Skill's own `policies/review-authority.md`; only
  relevant to `github-pr-review`)
- **Agent review ownership** — has another Code Review Agent already
  been assigned this review scope? (an orchestration question, governed
  by this file; relevant to both Skills)

Both must be respected independently: an identity may have GitHub
permissions but still not own the Agent review scope; an Agent may own
the review scope but lack GitHub permissions, in which case
`github-pr-review` still performs passive review rather than faking
active review.

## Multi-Agent guard

When a multi-Agent workflow already includes a Code Review Agent,
implementation Agents may test, lint, build, and self-check their own
implementation, but must not independently perform the formal review
responsibility assigned to the Code Review Agent. Avoid duplicate review
findings, duplicate GitHub comments, contradictory severity, contradictory
approval decisions, and multiple reviewers racing against different
HEADs.

## Parallel review scope

Default: one reviewer per PR/task scope. Separate Code Review Agents may
operate concurrently only on independent scopes, e.g.:

```text
PR #10 → Reviewer A
PR #11 → Reviewer B
```

For one very large PR, parallel review is allowed only if ownership is
explicitly partitioned. A coordinating reviewer must own deduplication,
consistent severity, and the final combined decision. Do not
automatically parallelize one review.
