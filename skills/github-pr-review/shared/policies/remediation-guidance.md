# Policy — Remediation Guidance

Applies to evidence-backed findings from both Code Review Skills. Guidance is
advisory output: it does not change finding identity, severity, deduplication,
Existing Review Evidence reconciliation, or the mechanically derived verdict.
It grants no ability to edit, patch, commit, push, branch, merge, or otherwise
mutate source or repository state.

## Evidence-grounded direction

When useful, give a concise recommended direction that addresses the evidenced
cause. This is the content of a finding's **Fix** field in
[`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md); the shorter field label
does not change what this policy governs. Prefer the canonical owner of an
invariant over patches at each symptom.

`Fix` states the smallest remediation that restores the current change's
contract, per [`remediation-scope-boundary.md`](remediation-scope-boundary.md)
— never a disproportionate rewrite pulled in because the review reasoned
deeply about a finding's broader implications, and never understated when
the current contract genuinely cannot be satisfied without a wider
boundary change. When that policy's reasoning identifies a broader,
legitimately separate concern alongside a bounded required fix, surface it
as a distinct, clearly labeled recommended follow-up (never merged into
`Fix` as if it were required in the current change, and never omitted
merely because it is out of scope) — see
[`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md), "Follow-up" field.

The **Fix** direction targets or describes the finding's canonical
fix/action location when one is known
([`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md), "Fix/action
location, evidence location, publication"). Remediation prose is
semantically connected to where the finding is anchored, but it does not
by itself decide publication placement: placement follows the resolved
finding-location contract, and a Skill's own placement policy (for
`github-pr-review`, `finding-placement.md`, "Anchor at the fix/action
location") remains its canonical owner.
The root-cause and model-completeness rules in
[`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md) govern grouping: one structural finding
gets one coherent remediation direction, not one instruction per manifestation.
The direction targets the shared cause or its canonical owner; the
manifestation sites are enumerated in the finding's affected-locations list
([`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md), "Affected locations on
a consolidated finding"), not repeated as separate directions.

For an external package, distinguish local misuse from an upstream defect. Fix
local misuse locally. Recommend an upgrade only when a fixed version or range is
verified, including evidenced compatibility or migration validation. When no
fixed version is verified, say to verify upstream availability or apply a
justified mitigation if upgrading is blocked; never invent a version.

## Skill-specific detail

This policy permits different delivery detail. `local-code-review` may, only by
the explicit `include_fix_prompt` opt-in, append a coding-agent-ready implementation prompt to an
existing actionable finding. `github-pr-review` remains reviewer-facing and
uses concise recommended directions; it does not emit the local full prompt.
Neither form may introduce unsupported architecture or arbitrary implementation
requirements.

`include_fix_guidance` controls only optional elaboration beyond the concise
canonical `Fix`. Its default is `true`; `false` keeps the mandatory `Fix` but
suppresses additional remediation explanation. Normalize it per
[`invocation-options.md`](invocation-options.md). Never restate the same
direction in both `Fix` and surrounding prose.
