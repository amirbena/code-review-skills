# Shared Policy — Parallel Review Capability

Applies to any Code Review Skill in this repository. Defines the **portable
contract** for splitting one review across independent workers when the
runtime exposes a reliable multi-agent / sub-agent capability. Runtime-specific
realisation (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) lives in each Skill's own
`policies/parallel-review.md`; this file is transport-neutral.

## Parallelism is an execution optimisation, never a semantic change

Given the same Review Target, Review Context, Repository Context, Existing
Review Evidence, and policies, **sequential and parallel execution must
produce equivalent final findings and decisions.** Parallelism changes only
*how fast* the analysis runs, never *what* it concludes. Sequential execution
is always a valid, complete implementation of this contract; a review is
never failed or downgraded because parallelism is unavailable.

**Sequential review is the default execution mode.** A simple review should
remain simple even when the runtime exposes parallel workers.

## Capability detection, not assumption

There is no universal "spawn agent" syntax. Before planning parallel work,
detect what the current runtime actually supports:

- **none** → sequential review;
- **ordinary isolated sub-agents** → parallel workers via that mechanism;
- **an experimental / opt-in agent-team mechanism** → usable only when its
  prerequisite is already satisfied in the environment; the Skill never
  enables it by mutating the user's configuration;
- **native concurrent agents / tasks** → parallel workers via that mechanism.

If detection is uncertain, treat the capability as **none**.

## Execution-policy decision

Select parallel review only when both gates pass:

```text
reliable runtime parallel capability?
    no  → sequential
    yes ↓
at least two materially independent analysis dimensions whose concurrent
execution is expected to reduce latency without reducing consistency?
    no  → sequential
    yes → parallel review
```

Do not use file count or any other single numeric threshold. Thirty renamed,
generated, or mechanical files may be trivial; three files may carry
independent architecture and correctness work. Relevant signals include
requirements/scope analysis, architecture or cross-component changes,
correctness/regression analysis, repository-policy validation,
configuration/infrastructure changes, substantial supplied context, several
independent subsystems, and meaningful existing-review reconciliation. No
single signal automatically requires workers, and do not invent dimensions
solely to justify spawning.

Only split dimensions that can begin from the same normalized shared inputs.
If one dimension needs another worker's result first, it is a sequential
dependency. Parallelize only when the expected latency reduction exceeds the
overhead of worker creation, context duplication, aggregation, and
reconciliation. When uncertain about consistency, coverage, independence, or
latency benefit, remain sequential.

## Pre-spawn context gate

Before selecting or starting workers, the parent resolves Review Target,
Review Context, Repository Context, Existing Review Evidence, applicable
repository instructions, and repository snapshot identity. Workers never
fetch Jira/Issue context, rediscover `AGENTS.md`, or choose a snapshot.

## Worker contract

Every worker receives one **bounded, normalized** input and returns
**structured candidate findings only** — it never publishes, never derives
the final decision, and never sees another worker's output. What a worker
is *allowed to hold and do* — the `spawn_agent` capability, budgets on
agent count/depth, and the read-only capability set below — is the
capability boundary owned by
[`agent-delegation.md`](agent-delegation.md); this section defines the
worker's task shape, not its authority.

```text
Worker input
- Review Target                    (identical for all workers in a run)
- Review Context                   (identical for all workers in a run)
- Repository Context location      (identical for all workers in a run)
- Repository snapshot identity     (identical for all workers in a run)
- Resolved repository instruction context and identity (identical for all workers)
- Existing Review Evidence         (identical for all workers in a run)
- Assigned review dimension        (differs per worker)
- Applicable policies              (the shared policies for that dimension)
```

The identical fields are the run's semantic snapshot:
every worker analyses the same PR base/head state and the same context. A
worker that received a different snapshot is a bug, not a smaller review.
The parent resolves hierarchical repository instructions exactly once before
planning or spawning workers; workers never rediscover them.

### Review dimensions

A reasonable default split (adjust to the change, do not force all five):

- **Scope / requirements** — does the change do what was asked, nothing
  unrelated; scope-boundary reasoning against supplied context.
- **Architecture / repository invariants** — repository policies,
  interfaces/contracts, architectural constraints, and the system-level
  dimensions a change materially implicates (see
  [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), "Semantic change-implication
  reasoning").
- **Correctness / regression** — logic, edge cases, failure/retry safety,
  contract/exception propagation, credible null-like absence risk (see
  [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), "Null-like absence-risk review"),
  and API/contract backward compatibility (see
  [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), "API / contract compatibility
  review").
- **Tests / configuration inspection** — test adequacy, missing regression
  tests, the impact of the change on existing tests that depend on the
  changed behavior (see [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), "Affected-test
  / test-impact analysis"), config/infra/CI changes (read as text only),
  and materially implicated dependency/build/supply-chain semantics (see
  [`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md), "Dependency / supply-chain
  deepening review").
- **Existing-review reconciliation** — prior findings / settled decisions
  per [`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md).

## Worker output format

A compact, portable structure — no provider conversation metadata. Each
candidate finding can represent:

- affected file / location;
- concise finding;
- evidence;
- impact;
- **candidate** severity (P0 / P1 / P2);
- review dimension / source worker;
- optional related prior finding or context.

Prefer the existing finding shape
([`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md)) rendered as structured
Markdown; do not invent JSON infrastructure. "Candidate" severity is a
worker's proposal only — the aggregator owns the final severity.

## Centralized aggregation

Workers never decide independently. All results flow through one
reconciliation stage:

```text
worker findings → normalize → deduplicate → reconcile overlapping/conflicting
               → apply canonical severity semantics (severity.md)
               → derive one decision (severity.md, "Decision derivation")
```

Only this aggregator produces the final P0/P1/P2 set, `REVIEW CLEAN` /
`CHANGES REQUIRED` (local) or `Approve` / `Request Changes` (GitHub), and any
published review. **Worker completion order never affects the result.** On a
duplicate (same location, same normalized claim), the higher candidate
severity is carried and the finding is reported once.

## Failure handling — parallelism never manufactures `REVIEW CLEAN`

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Parallel capability unavailable | Fall back to sequential analysis of every dimension. |
| An **optional** worker failed / timed out / returned malformed output / was cancelled | The parent reviewer performs that dimension itself where feasible; the review is still graded. |
| A **required** analysis dimension could not be produced (by a worker or the parent) | Return an incomplete / ungraded state per the consuming Skill's own runbook — **never** a clean/approved result. |

Missing coverage is reported as missing, not as absence of findings.

## Boundaries

- **No new mutation.** Parallel workers are read-only; publication and any
  Approve/Request Changes stay the aggregating reviewer's, once — enforced
  as a capability boundary, not only a behavioral expectation, by
  [`agent-delegation.md`](agent-delegation.md).
- **Review target unchanged.** Splitting the review by dimension never widens
  the target or the scope — each worker is bounded to the same PR delta and
  its real blast radius.
- **Decision derivation unchanged.** The aggregator applies
  [`severity.md`](severity.md) exactly as a sequential review would.
