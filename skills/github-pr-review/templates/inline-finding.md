# Template — Inline Finding

Canonical form for a single inline GitHub review comment, submitted only
as part of one batched review submission (see
[`../policies/review-output.md`](../policies/review-output.md), "Batched
review construction and submission" — never published individually as
findings are discovered). Renders the shared finding shape from
[`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md)
for GitHub's inline-comment surface — the same fields and quality
contract, projected onto a surface that already supplies the file/line
anchor and the comment's own identity, so `id` and `Location` are
omitted here (see
[`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
"Canonical inline rendering"). Only finding content renders here; the
private [`reviewer-brief.md`](reviewer-brief.md) is never one of this
template's inputs and never appears in an inline comment — see
[`../policies/reviewer-brief.md`](../policies/reviewer-brief.md), "Never
published to GitHub."

```text
[<severity>] <short, concrete title>

Evidence: <concrete evidence — what the code actually does>

Impact: <concrete engineering consequence — why it matters>

Fix: <concrete correction direction, when useful>
```

`<severity>` renders the bare `P0` / `P1` / `P2` code by default: e.g.
`[P1] Incomplete pagination can produce a false clean review`. When the
invocation selects `include_severity_description` (default `false` — see
[`../policies/review-output.md`](../policies/review-output.md),
"Reader-visible severity legend"), the heading instead renders
`[<severity> (<compact meaning>)]`, where `<compact meaning>` is this
Skill's severity legend — `P0 (Critical)` / `P1 (Blocking)` /
`P2 (Non-Blocking)` — e.g. `[P1 (Blocking)] Incomplete pagination can
produce a false clean review` (see "Severity description (opt-in)"
below). Either way it is rendered once, in this heading, never repeated
as a separate explanatory sentence in `Evidence`, `Impact`, or `Fix`.

A finding that meets
[`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
"When a longer explanation is justified" (non-obvious cross-file
behavior, a concurrency/ordering bug, a security implication, a complex
invariant violation, or evidence needing brief context) adds one
`Details:` line after `Fix`, kept to a short paragraph, only when
`include_finding_details=true` or a finding-level decision enables it. The
GitHub default is `false`. An ordinary finding does not.

```text
Details: <supporting technical context, concise>
```

## Rules

- severity always visible first, in the bare `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]`
  form by default, or the `[P0 (Critical)]` / `[P1 (Blocking)]` /
  `[P2 (Non-Blocking)]` form when `include_severity_description` is on
  (see [`../policies/review-output.md`](../policies/review-output.md),
  "Reader-visible severity legend");
- **one authoritative representation, minimum self-contained unit.** This
  inline comment is the finding's one full representation once published:
  severity + compact title in the heading, then the concrete what/why/fix
  carried by `Evidence` / `Impact` / `Fix`. It is self-contained — a
  reader needs nothing else to act on it — and it is never a near-
  duplicate of the review-body line that points to it: the body carries
  only the summary-pointer form (severity, title, location), never a
  second copy of this comment's `Evidence` / `Impact` / `Fix` content
  (see [`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
  "Rules");
- no meta-commentary about the review process — state the result, not
  that a file was inspected or a reproduction attempted, beyond what the
  `Validation` / runtime-validation contract already records;
- no agent/model/tool disclosure anywhere in this comment (see
  [`../policies/review-output.md`](../policies/review-output.md), "No
  agent/model/tool disclosure");
- title is concise (a few words, not a sentence) and names the actual
  defect, not a vague category;
- each field is concise by default — `Evidence`, `Impact`, and `Fix` are
  a line or two; the GitHub UI already supplies file and line context, so
  do not add redundant `id:`, `Location:`, `file:`, `line:`,
  `reviewed_head:`, or other machine fields;
- a longer explanation is the controlled exception, not the default —
  only a finding in one of the
  [`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
  "When a longer explanation is justified" categories gets a `Details:`
  line, and even then it stays a short paragraph, never an essay;
- evidence-based (see
  [`../shared/policies/evidence.md`](../shared/policies/evidence.md))
  — no generic "this could be improved" / "consider refactoring" comments
  with no concrete basis, and no praise on an inline comment;
- `Fix` is concise and reviewer-facing; never append a local full
  **Implementation prompt** or a coding-agent workflow;
- no duplicated findings across multiple lines or against an
  already-reviewed, unchanged HEAD (see
  [`../policies/pr-scope.md`](../policies/pr-scope.md), "Existing
  review awareness");
- anchor at the finding's canonical fix/action location — the line an
  author changes to resolve it — not merely where the problem is
  observable and not a line chosen because GitHub allows a comment there
  (see
  [`../policies/finding-placement.md`](../policies/finding-placement.md),
  "Anchor at the fix/action location"). The `Evidence` text may name a
  distinct evidence/source location, including one in another file. If
  the fix/action location is unresolved, is not inline-commentable, or
  the finding is cross-cutting / spans multiple files, the finding
  belongs in the review body instead (see the same policy, "Inline
  comment eligibility");
- a **consolidated root-cause finding** (one shared cause reaching two or
  more call paths) is placed in the review body, not inline, and is never
  split into one inline comment per affected call path (see
  [`../policies/finding-placement.md`](../policies/finding-placement.md),
  "Inline comment eligibility"). If a short non-authoritative inline
  pointer at the shared cause is used, it names the affected call paths in
  its prose — the required, exhaustive affected-locations list lives with
  the body finding, per
  [`../shared/templates/finding.md`](../shared/templates/finding.md),
  "Affected locations on a consolidated finding".

## Example

```text
[P1] Incomplete pagination can produce a false clean review

Evidence: This path retrieves only the first page of changed files and
does not continue using the returned pagination cursor.

Impact: Files outside the first page may never be reviewed while the
workflow can still reach REVIEW CLEAN.

Fix: Exhaust pagination and verify scope completeness before permitting
a clean review decision.
```

## Severity description (opt-in)

When the invocation selects `include_severity_description` (see
[`../shared/policies/invocation-options.md`](../shared/policies/invocation-options.md),
"`include_severity_description` phrasings" — default `false`), the same
example above instead renders:

```text
[P1 (Blocking)] Incomplete pagination can produce a false clean review

Evidence: This path retrieves only the first page of changed files and
does not continue using the returned pagination cursor.

Impact: Files outside the first page may never be reviewed while the
workflow can still reach REVIEW CLEAN.

Fix: Exhaust pagination and verify scope completeness before permitting
a clean review decision.
```

This is the same finding, at the same location, with the same severity
and identity — only the heading gains the parenthetical description,
inside the same unemphasized-but-first-position slot it already
occupies. It composes independently with `human_inline_findings`: an
expanded human-rendered inline finding reads
`P1 (Blocking): Paginated file listing stops after page 1` (see
"Human-rendered inline finding (opt-in)" below).

## Human-rendered inline finding (opt-in)

When the invocation normalizes `human_inline_findings` (see
[`../shared/policies/invocation-options.md`](../shared/policies/invocation-options.md),
"`human_inline_findings` derived default and phrasings" — its default is
derived from `human_review_output`, so senior-mode reviews get this by
default), this comment is rendered in the concise senior-engineer voice
from
[`../shared/templates/finding-rendering.md`](../shared/templates/finding-rendering.md),
"Canonical human inline rendering" instead of the
`[<severity>] / Evidence / Impact / Fix` block above — a short heading
that keeps the severity (and its optional legend description, when
`include_severity_description` is on) and names the finding, then
compact prose. The voice itself is owned by the shared
[`../shared/templates/finding-rendering.md`](../shared/templates/finding-rendering.md),
"Senior voice contract" — including no dedicated praise slot and no
first-person/hedging on a required fix:

```text
P1: Paginated file listing stops after page 1

`list_files()` reads only the first page, so a large PR can reach a
false clean review with files that were never seen. Exhaust the
pagination before permitting a clean decision.
```

```text
P2: Sync and async retry paths decide eligibility separately

`should_retry()` in the sync flow and the inline check in
`AsyncRunner.retry` already disagree on 429 handling. Move eligibility
into one helper that both paths call.
```

When `include_severity_description` is on, the same headings instead
read `P1 (Blocking): Paginated file listing stops after page 1` and
`P2 (Non-Blocking): Sync and async retry paths decide eligibility
separately` — the parenthetical composes with this voice exactly as it
does with the structured form, with no other change.

This is a re-voicing of the **same finding**, not a different or weaker
one. Unchanged:

- **severity** — still shown first, in the heading, in the same bare or
  legend-expanded form as the structured form and controlled by the same
  option (`P1: …` / `P1 (Blocking): …`, never `[P1] …`);
- the mandatory What / Where / Evidence / Impact / Fix core — evidence,
  the engineering consequence when it is material, and the actionable
  correction direction are still all present, carried by the prose; a
  genuine open question stays a question; no praise, no generic
  "consider refactoring", and a required fix like this one is stated
  directly, never as a first-person suggestion;
- evidence and remediation requirements, finding identity and
  deduplication, the one-authoritative-representation rule, same-HEAD /
  re-review awareness, and the batched single review submission;
- the **publication anchor** — the comment still sits at the finding's
  canonical fix/action location per
  [`../policies/finding-placement.md`](../policies/finding-placement.md),
  "Anchor at the fix/action location", the prose may still name a
  distinct evidence/source location (including one in another file), and
  an unresolved or not-inline-commentable fix/action location still
  falls back to the review body per that policy. Rendering voice never
  moves a finding.

A justified longer explanation (`include_finding_details` or a
finding-level decision) folds into the prose as one extra short
paragraph rather than a `Details:` label. When `human_inline_findings`
is off — explicitly, or because `human_review_output` is off and nothing
enabled it — this comment uses the structured block above, unchanged.
