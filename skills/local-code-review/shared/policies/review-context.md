# Shared Policy — Review Context Model

Applies identically to `local-code-review` and `github-pr-review`, in every
mode. It defines the concepts a review reasons over and how optional,
caller-supplied requirement/scope material is used. Each Skill keeps only a
thin policy of its own naming *what its review target is*
(`skills/local-code-review/policies/review-context.md`,
`skills/github-pr-review/policies/review-context.md`); the semantics below are
not restated there.

Existing prior-review material (previous findings, resolved findings, settled
decisions, maintainer clarifications) is a distinct concept with its own
canonical policy — [`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md). This file
covers the other three concepts and the requirement-context semantics.

## The four concepts

- **Review target** — the implementation actually under review, and the only
  thing whose defects a decision blocks. `local-code-review`: the local
  implementation delta (committed / staged / unstaged / untracked, per that
  Skill's `repository-state.md`). `github-pr-review`: the GitHub Pull Request
  delta. Context never expands it.
- **Review context** — evidence used to understand the *intended scope and
  requirements* of the change: explicit user instructions, a Jira/tracker
  ticket, acceptance criteria, a GitHub Issue, an HLD, an ADR, an
  implementation plan, a PR/task description, migration/security/performance/
  rollout requirements. Optional. Shapes what the reviewer inspects and what
  "correct" and "in scope" mean for this change. Never a verdict; never a
  substitute for reading the code.
- **Repository context** — surrounding repository evidence needed to judge
  correctness and invariants: `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` and other
  repository-local instructions (discovered per
  [`repository-instructions.md`](repository-instructions.md)), architecture
  documentation, related interfaces, surrounding implementation, tests,
  configuration, and repository invariants. Refines *how* the changed code is
  evaluated.
- **Existing review evidence** — previously produced review information that
  may bear on this review — see [`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md).

## Review context is optional; its absence changes nothing

Review context is opt-in. When none is supplied, each Skill behaves exactly as
if this input did not exist, and never asks the user to provide it. Optional
free-form/textual context that is missing, empty, or not provided is **never**
a reason to fail, block, or degrade the review — the review proceeds on
repository/diff-driven reasoning alone.

A **supplied reference** is different from missing context: see "Reference-based
context requires resolution" below. A Jira reference the caller deliberately
supplied to establish task boundaries, but which cannot be resolved, is not
silently ignored — that invocation's Jira-scoped path stops with an explicit
unresolved report. This does not make Jira mandatory for ordinary reviews.

## Input form

### Textual / free-form context — consumed directly

Any of the following, supplied by the caller as text, is simply review context
— the reviewer treats it uniformly regardless of which category it came from,
with no resolution step:

- explicit user instructions describing intent or focus;
- pasted requirements or acceptance criteria;
- pasted Jira (or equivalent tracker) ticket text — description and/or
  acceptance criteria — when the caller provides the *content*, not just a key;
- a GitHub Issue's pasted description and relevant authoritative comments;
- an HLD, architecture/design document, or ADR (text or excerpt);
- an implementation plan;
- a bug/incident description or follow-up;
- a PR/task description;
- migration, security, performance, or rollout requirements/constraints.

A caller may optionally label the source (e.g. `Context source: Jira
PROJECT-1234`) to aid traceability; an unlabeled free-form block is equally
valid.

### Reference-based context — requires resolution

A bare **reference** — a Jira ticket key or URL, or a GitHub Issue reference —
is a *pointer to context, not the context itself*. Before it can inform review
reasoning it must be resolved to normalized context:

- a **Jira reference** is resolved per "Jira context resolution" below;
- a **GitHub Issue reference** is resolved through available read-only GitHub
  access (the same access `github-pr-review` uses for PR state); if no such
  access is available, the caller may instead paste the Issue text as
  free-form context. No automatic PR↔Issue discovery.

A reference is never treated as if the identifier itself carried the ticket's
requirements.

## Jira context resolution

When the caller supplies a Jira reference, it is resolved to normalized
`ReviewContext` **before** any review reasoning that depends on scope,
through whatever Jira read capability the runtime exposes (MCP server,
connector, or equivalent). Resolution is read-only. When a supplied Jira
reference cannot be resolved, the Jira-scoped path stops with an explicit
`JIRA CONTEXT UNRESOLVED` report rather than falling back to the reference
text — but this never makes Jira mandatory for reviews that do not supply
one. The full procedure, the comment-classification rules, and the
precondition semantics are owned by
[`jira-context.md`](jira-context.md).

For this phase, a GitHub Issue is supplied explicitly (a reference or its
text). There is **no automatic PR↔Issue discovery** in this model — the
linkage, if any, is whatever the caller states.

## Recommended internal normalization

Prefer normalizing supplied context into a small internal structure rather
than scattering raw text through review reasoning — illustrative, not a
mandatory schema; skip structure entirely for a short, already-concrete block:

```text
ReviewContext
- source_type: optional (free-form | user-instructions | jira | github-issue |
  hld | adr | implementation-plan | bug-description | incident-followup |
  pr-description | acceptance-criteria | other)
- source_name: optional (e.g. "PROJECT-1234", "Payments HLD", "#412")
- raw_context: the supplied text
- intended_behavior: what the change is supposed to accomplish
- acceptance_criteria: explicit pass/fail conditions, if stated
- constraints / invariants: things that must remain true
- explicit_non_goals: what the context says is out of scope
```

## Evidence hierarchy

Review context describes *intended* behavior. It never substitutes for
verifying *actual* behavior. When sources disagree about what the code does,
resolve using this precedence, strongest first:

1. actual code / diff / tests / configuration;
2. repository-local instructions and architecture (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
   in-repo ADRs the repository itself treats as canonical — discovered per
   [`repository-instructions.md`](repository-instructions.md));
3. explicit review context supplied to this Skill (this policy) and settled
   existing review evidence ([`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md));
4. reviewer inference.

Concretely:

- Do not state that something is implemented merely because the context says
  it should be — inspect the implementation.
- Do not let context override clear repository evidence to the contrary; see
  "Context mismatch vs. implementation defect" below.
- Context may legitimately fill gaps the diff alone can't answer (why a change
  exists, what "correct" means for it) — that is its proper use.

## Using context to focus review attention

When context exists, derive review targets from it rather than treating it as
background color:

- **"Validation must happen before any external execution"** → focus on
  validation location, call ordering, bypass paths, retry/post-approval flows,
  error handling, and tests proving no execution occurs before validation.
- **"Processing is at-least-once"** → focus on idempotency, duplicate handling,
  retry behavior, transactional boundaries, side effects.
- **"Existing behavior X must remain unchanged"** → focus on regression risk,
  shared paths, branching logic, and existing tests covering X.

Context shapes *what the reviewer looks for*, never *what conclusion the
reviewer must reach*. The review still independently determines, from the
actual delta, whether the described behavior holds.

## Context mismatch vs. implementation defect

Reason carefully about discrepancies between context, repository behavior, the
diff, and tests. Distinguish:

- **Implementation clearly violates an explicit requirement** — report a
  finding, severity based on actual impact per
  [`severity.md`](severity.md), never inherited from the context's own
  emphasis or wording.
- **Context appears stale or conflicts with repository architecture** — do not
  automatically treat the implementation as wrong. State the conflict and the
  evidence on each side; let the reader judge. A note, not an automatic
  finding against either side.
- **Requirement is ambiguous** — do not invent a missing requirement or guess
  intent. Report the ambiguity when it is material to a finding.
- **Context describes work outside the current target** — do not demand
  unrelated implementation merely because the context mentions it. Raise it
  only when the current change creates a regression against it or was
  explicitly expected to complete it.

## Scope-boundary reasoning

Context lets the reviewer reason explicitly about the boundary of the
requested change. Where context makes it possible, detect:

- **Required behavior missing** — an acceptance criterion or stated
  requirement the change was expected to satisfy is not implemented.
- **Implementation contradicts acceptance criteria** — the change does
  something the criteria explicitly forbid, or fails a stated pass condition.
- **Unrelated scope expansion** — the change also does something outside the
  requested scope. A finding when the unrelated addition carries real risk or
  violates a stated non-goal / agreed scope; otherwise a noted observation,
  non-blocking unless it independently meets the P0/P1 bar.
- **Valid-but-out-of-scope finding** — a technically real issue that is
  outside the requested change. Still reported when the change introduces or
  activates it; noted as outside the requested scope. A pre-existing,
  unrelated defect merely noticed nearby stays out — see
  [`evidence.md`](evidence.md), "Findings beyond the changed lines."
- **Repository-policy violation** — a repository convention or invariant the
  change breaks. Relevant regardless of ticket scope: a ticket cannot license
  violating the target repository's own stated rules.

### Precedence when scope sources disagree

There is no rigid global priority order. Resolve conflicts by reasoning about
authority and recency, informed by these tendencies:

- **Repository policy and invariants can constrain the implementation even
  when a ticket says otherwise.** A tracker ticket does not override the
  target repository's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` rules or a safety invariant.
- **An accepted ADR/HLD decision generally outweighs speculative ticket
  discussion** on the same design question. A settled decision (see
  [`review-evidence.md`](review-evidence.md), "Settled decisions") is not
  reopened by an offhand comment.
- **Newer explicit maintainer clarification supersedes stale earlier
  discussion.** A later, direct statement of intent wins over an older
  contradictory one.
- Among requirement sources of comparable authority, the **more specific and
  more recently agreed** statement governs (acceptance criteria over a vague
  summary; a PR description that refines a ticket over the ticket's original
  wording).
- Actual code/config always wins on *what currently happens*; these
  precedence notes are about *what the change was supposed to do*.

When a material conflict cannot be resolved from the evidence, report the
ambiguity rather than silently picking a side.

## Explicit non-goals

When supplied context states something is explicitly out of scope (e.g. "do
not implement shard failover"), that statement is useful review context: it
prevents the reviewer from treating the corresponding gap as a
missing-implementation finding. It is never exploited to wave away a genuine
regression the current change introduces. **A stated non-goal narrows what's
expected to be *built*; it never narrows what's expected to be *safe*.**

## Scope discipline: no scope explosion

Optional context improves precision; it never turns a review into a full
architecture or requirements audit. Review the current change; use context to
identify relevant execution paths, invariants, acceptance criteria,
architectural boundaries, regressions, missing tests, and edge cases *within
that change*. Do not start reporting unrelated pre-existing architecture
problems because a design document mentions the surrounding system. Existing
scope and delta-review rules ([`review-scope.md`](review-scope.md),
[`evidence.md`](evidence.md), "Findings beyond the changed lines") remain
authoritative — this policy narrows attention *within* that scope, never
widens the scope itself.

## Tracing findings back to context

When a finding comes specifically from supplied context — it would not have
been raised, or its severity would not be justified, without that context —
make the relationship visible in the finding's own Evidence, per
[`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md):

```text
P1 — Validation can be bypassed on the bulk-update path

Evidence:
Context source: Jira PROJECT-1234, acceptance criteria — "a record is
validated before every write path." <concrete code evidence that the
bulk-update path persists without going through that validation>.
```

Use it when it materially explains why the behavior is incorrect or risky —
not on every finding, and never as a second, duplicate listing of the finding.

The finding carries this provenance in its optional **contextual evidence**
field, per [`../templates/finding.md`](../templates/finding.md), "Contextual
evidence and provenance". The typed authority of each contextual source
(authoritative vs. informational), the rule that an informal discussion never
silently overrides an explicit requirement or an approved decision, and the
resolution of conflicting, stale, or ambiguous context are the
contextual-evidence model — a repository-development design record, named
here rather than linked because it is not a packaged resource. This policy is
not the place to restate that model.

## Output

Supplied context that had no material effect on the review is not called out.
When context materially shaped the review — it focused attention that produced
a finding, surfaced a mismatch worth flagging, or its non-goals prevented a
false gap being reported — state it concisely in each Skill's optional
context section (see each Skill's own report/summary template). The decision
labels and their mechanical derivation are unchanged by this policy: context
informs which findings exist and their severity exactly as any other evidence
source would — see [`severity.md`](severity.md), "Decision derivation
(mechanical)." It never adds a separate decision path.

## Boundaries

- **Read-only.** This policy adds interpretation of supplied text and
  retrieval of referenced context; it never grants either Skill a
  state-changing capability. It can never authorize editing files, applying
  patches, committing, pushing, any GitHub mutation, or any **Jira mutation**
  (editing/transitioning an issue, adding a comment, changing a field,
  creating a ticket, assigning a user) — each Skill's own mutation boundary is
  unchanged, and Jira access is context retrieval only.
- **A reference is not the context.** A Jira key/URL or a GitHub Issue
  reference is a pointer that must be resolved to normalized context before
  use — see "Reference-based context requires resolution." Jira context
  informs scope but never expands the Review Target.
- **Invocation approval unchanged.** Supplying context (a Jira reference or a
  GitHub Issue included) is never itself approval to invoke a Skill and never
  bypasses `local-code-review`'s per-invocation approval contract
  (`skills/local-code-review/policies/invocation-approval.md`) or
  `github-pr-review`'s self-review mutation boundary — authorship still
  withholds a formal `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` on the reviewer's own
  work (`skills/github-pr-review/policies/review-authority.md`).
- **Target unchanged.** Context never converts a Jira ticket, an Issue, an
  ADR, or a PR description into an additional review target. The review target
  stays the local delta / the PR.
