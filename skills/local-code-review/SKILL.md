# SKILL.md — local-code-review

A small, bounded, **stateless** Code Review Skill that reviews a local Git
repository's implementation state (committed delta, staged, unstaged, and
untracked) and returns structured P0/P1/P2 findings. It is a reviewer
only — never an orchestrator, a fix loop, a Git-mutating agent, or a
GitHub-publishing agent.

**Use it** on local/uncommitted work before a push or PR. For an existing
GitHub Pull Request, use the sibling `github-pr-review` Skill.

**Compatibility:** requires a local Git repository; an optional PR
reference additionally requires read-only GitHub access.

## Safety boundaries (read before invoking)

The entry contract. Full text lives in the linked canonical policies;
restated here because hiding them behind a link would be dangerous.

- **Opt-in only.** This Skill **MUST NOT be invoked automatically.**
  Every invocation — first review *and* every re-review after fixes —
  requires fresh, explicit user approval scoped to that one run, obtained
  by the caller. Generic "check your work" language, a standing
  preference, repository or orchestration policy, and silence/non-objection
  never qualify. Returning findings from one invocation is never, by
  itself, authorization for the caller to invoke this Skill again after
  fixes. A separate, explicit approval is required for every subsequent
  invocation. Delegating as an Agent/Sub-Agent never moves the decision
  away from the end user. Canonical owner:
  [`policies/invocation-approval.md`](policies/invocation-approval.md).
- **Review ownership.** `One review scope → one Code Review Agent owner`.
  If another Code Review Agent already owns this local branch/scope,
  return `REVIEW ALREADY OWNED` and do not launch a competing review —
  see [`review-ownership.md`](shared/policies/review-ownership.md).
- **Severity → verdict is mechanical.** Findings are P0/P1/P2. **P0** and
  **P1** block; **P2** never blocks, however strongly recommended or
  wherever it originated. The `REVIEW CLEAN` / `CHANGES REQUIRED` decision
  is derived once, mechanically, from whether any P0/P1 is present — never
  a separate judgment call. Canonical owner:
  [`severity.md`](shared/policies/severity.md), "Decision
  derivation (mechanical)."
- **Read-only.** This Skill never edits files, applies patches, commits,
  pushes, rebases, creates branches, opens PRs, or mutates GitHub (see
  section 6). Repository-state safety — including reviewing directly on a
  protected/default branch — is owned by
  [`policies/repository-state.md`](policies/repository-state.md) and
  [`git-safety.md`](shared/policies/git-safety.md).

## Review flow (high level)

```text
resolve scope → discover per-file AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md → inspect the Git
delta by category (committed, staged, unstaged, untracked) → compute the
staged-delta fingerprint → [optional] resolve a Jira reference (read-only;
else JIRA CONTEXT UNRESOLVED) / map review context / reconcile a PR
reference's prior findings — all onto the delta, never widening it →
resolve the shared runtime-validation policy and record any safe validation
outcome → inspect surrounding code → review against code + conventions,
focused by context → classify by severity (source never changes it) → derive the
decision mechanically from blocking (P0/P1) severities → return, stop
```

The optional Jira and PR inputs never widen scope: the local delta stays
the Review Target. Full procedure:
[`runbooks/local-review.md`](runbooks/local-review.md). Output contract:
[`templates/local-review-report.md`](templates/local-review-report.md).

## 1. Inputs

**Required:** a local Git repository. The Skill inspects the four
repository-state categories owned by
[`policies/repository-state.md`](policies/repository-state.md) —
committed delta relative to a base, staged, unstaged, untracked — never
one undifferentiated "relevant files" blend, plus surrounding code,
tests, and repository instructions as needed. Push/synchronization status
is resolved against the branch's configured upstream, never the review
base. The full implementation state is reviewed; no category is silently
skipped without saying so in the report.

**Optional — review context** describing the intended change, per
[`review-context.md`](shared/policies/review-context.md), "Input
form" (thin local application:
[`policies/review-context.md`](policies/review-context.md)):

- **Textual / free-form** — requirements, explicit instructions, pasted
  ticket text or acceptance criteria, a pasted GitHub Issue, an HLD/ADR,
  an implementation plan, or migration/security/performance/rollout
  requirements. Consumed directly.
- **Reference-based** — a bare Jira key/URL or GitHub Issue reference is a
  pointer, not the context. A **Jira reference** is resolved **before**
  review reasoning via the shared policy's "Jira context resolution" →
  "Resolution procedure" (available Jira MCP/connector, read-only,
  normalize, continue only on success). If it cannot be resolved, this
  Skill does **not** infer ticket contents from the key, branch name, or
  surrounding text and returns `JIRA CONTEXT UNRESOLVED`. A GitHub Issue
  reference is resolved through read-only GitHub access or pasted text; no
  automatic PR↔Issue discovery.

Supplied context focuses attention and enables scope-boundary reasoning;
it is never authority over implementation evidence and never widens the
review target. When omitted, behavior is exactly as if it did not exist;
this Skill never asks for it and Jira is never mandatory.

**Optional:** a reference to an associated GitHub PR (a PR URL, or a PR
number when the repository is unambiguous). When supplied, this Skill
reconciles the local delta against relevant existing reviewer findings,
prior review comments, and settled architectural/design decisions from
that PR as Existing Review Evidence, per
[`review-evidence.md`](shared/policies/review-evidence.md) and
[`policies/pr-context.md`](policies/pr-context.md). The local delta always
remains the review target. When omitted, this Skill's behavior is exactly
as if this input did not exist. The two optional inputs are independent —
either, both, or neither.

**Optional — presentation/remediation options**, normalized for the
current invocation only per
[`invocation-options.md`](shared/policies/invocation-options.md):

- `include_fix_prompt` (boolean, default `false`).
  An explicit output-only opt-in: when `true`, a qualifying actionable
  finding may append a coding-agent-ready implementation prompt. The flag
  never changes the Review Target, inspection, evidence, finding
  identity, severity, deduplication, PR-context reconciliation, or the
  mechanical Decision, and it never authorizes mutation or an autonomous
  fix workflow. Only remediation rendering differs. Not inferred from
  urgency, severity, branch name, or intent.
- `include_fix_guidance` (default `true`) — remediation elaboration;
  never removes the mandatory concise `Fix`.
- `include_finding_details` (default `true`) — the optional supporting
  `Details` field.
- `human_review_output` (boolean, default `false`) — requested in natural
  language ("make the review shorter and more human", "like a senior
  engineer"; no flag). Renders only the human-facing body (Result →
  Decision) in a concise senior-engineer voice; the trailing "Review
  Metadata" / "Review scope contract" sections still follow it unchanged.
  Output-only: it never changes the Review Target, inspection, evidence,
  finding identity, severity, deduplication, PR-context reconciliation, or
  the mechanical Decision.
- `human_inline_findings` (derived default — `explicit_value ??
  human_review_output`) — a `github-pr-review` inline-comment concept,
  recognized here only for direct/mediated normalization parity; it has
  no effect on local output (no inline-comment surface).

## 2. Required Policy Loading

Always, as one batched operation:
[`review-scope.md`](shared/policies/review-scope.md),
[`change-risk-signals.md`](shared/policies/change-risk-signals.md) (deterministic `standard`/`elevated`/`deep` review-depth classification, emitted with every review),
[`repository-expansion.md`](shared/policies/repository-expansion.md) (fixed expansion-trigger catalog, bounded ring-based expansion scaled by change-risk depth, emitted with every review),
[`large-pr-partitioning.md`](shared/policies/large-pr-partitioning.md) (deterministic partitioning of an unusually large diff into coherent review units, each fully reviewed, with cross-partition aggregation/de-duplication; conditional on a diff-size threshold),
[`review-stopping-criteria.md`](shared/policies/review-stopping-criteria.md) (coverage and exit conditions scaled by change-risk depth and partitions, the closed set of incomplete triggers, and the rule that an incomplete review never renders as clean; emitted with every review),
[`severity.md`](shared/policies/severity.md),
[`evidence.md`](shared/policies/evidence.md),
[`repository-instructions.md`](shared/policies/repository-instructions.md),
[`review-base-policy.md`](shared/policies/review-base-policy.md)
(repository-relative review-base compliance; fail-closed when the
required base cannot be reliably resolved),
[`runtime-validation.md`](shared/policies/runtime-validation.md),
[`review-context.md`](shared/policies/review-context.md) (its
requirement-context and scope-boundary sections bind only when context is
supplied),
[`requirement-coverage.md`](shared/policies/requirement-coverage.md) (conditional),
[`git-safety.md`](shared/policies/git-safety.md),
[`file-reviewability.md`](shared/policies/file-reviewability.md)
(every changed-file category, including generated/opaque content),
[`invocation-options.md`](shared/policies/invocation-options.md),
[`remediation-guidance.md`](shared/policies/remediation-guidance.md),
[`finding.md`](shared/templates/finding.md) (the finding schema and
quality/conciseness contract every finding in the report must satisfy),
[`finding-rendering.md`](shared/templates/finding-rendering.md)
(the canonical full rendering used for every finding in this Skill's
report),
and [`review-summary.md`](shared/templates/review-summary.md). In
orchestrated/ multi-Agent contexts, also
[`review-ownership.md`](shared/policies/review-ownership.md).

This Skill's own, always:
[`policies/invocation-approval.md`](policies/invocation-approval.md) (the
per-invocation explicit-user-approval contract — see section 5) and
[`policies/repository-state.md`](policies/repository-state.md) (category
definitions, per-category detection commands, staged-delta fingerprint).

Conditionally, only when its own input is supplied per section 1: the
shared `review-context.md` requirement-context / scope-boundary sections
plus [`policies/review-context.md`](policies/review-context.md) (review
context), plus shared `requirement-coverage.md` for authoritative task-contract
context; the shared
[`review-evidence.md`](shared/policies/review-evidence.md) plus
[`policies/pr-context.md`](policies/pr-context.md) (PR reference). Each
loads independently. **This policy is never loaded or applied when no PR
reference is supplied**, and likewise for review context.

This Skill defines no severity, evidence, or scope policy of its own — it
consumes the shared ones so both Skills apply one standard. None of the
files above depend on another's content to be read — load them together
in a single batched/parallel operation rather than one at a time in
sequence.

## 3. Output Contract

Exactly one
[`templates/local-review-report.md`](templates/local-review-report.md)
per invocation, rendering the shared shape in
[`review-summary.md`](shared/templates/review-summary.md): a
Result, What changed, optional What was done well, an optional Context
section (only when review context materially shaped the review), an
optional PR Context section (only when a PR reference materially shaped
it), Findings (omitted when empty), conditional Requirement coverage, Validation, and
a Decision of `REVIEW CLEAN` or `CHANGES REQUIRED` derived mechanically
from blocking (P0/P1) severities.

Machine detail (base/HEAD SHAs, synchronization status, raw counts,
per-category inclusion/exclusion, staged-delta fingerprint) is
subordinate — a trailing plain-Markdown metadata block, never ahead of
the human-facing review. The fingerprint and the previously-reviewed-state
comparison are always computed; their *display* is relevance-gated per
the report template. The report is returned to the caller as one complete
document — never published, never streamed finding-by-finding. With
`include_fix_prompt=false` (default) findings carry no full implementation
prompt, and a clean review never manufactures implementation work.

## 4. Statelessness and Orchestration Boundary

Each invocation is `current state → review → findings → stop`, with no
memory of prior invocations. This Skill does **not**: decide whether
another iteration should run; count or cap review-loop attempts; control
the implementing Agent; commit, push, or open PRs; ask the user for
approval to run; or assume a prior approval extends to this or any future
invocation. On its own side of the
boundary owned by
[`policies/invocation-approval.md`](policies/invocation-approval.md), it
does not ask for approval, does not track prior approvals, and does not
decide whether a re-review should happen — every invocation still
requires fresh, explicit user approval scoped to that one run, and this
Skill can neither verify nor needs to verify that it occurred. Running it
as a delegated Agent/Sub-Agent is purely mechanical and never changes who
owns the decision to invoke it. Loop limits and re-review timing are an
orchestration concern; for recommended (not enforced) re-review
discipline see [`runbooks/local-review.md`](runbooks/local-review.md).
This Skill holds no `spawn_agent` capability of its own — it is a single
bounded invocation with no worker fan-out; see
[`agent-delegation.md`](shared/policies/agent-delegation.md),
"`spawn_agent` is an explicit capability" (absent by default).

## 5. Mutation Boundary

This Skill must never: edit files, apply patches, commit, push, rebase,
create branches, open PRs, approve anything, or request changes on
GitHub. The implementing Agent owns remediation; the orchestrator owns
workflow progression; this Skill only reviews and reports. This holds
identically when an optional PR reference is supplied per section 1:
reading PR review context is read-only and never becomes GitHub
publication, an Approve/Request Changes decision, or any other GitHub
mutation — see [`policies/pr-context.md`](policies/pr-context.md),
"Boundary with `github-pr-review`."

## 6. Configuration

None. This Skill package intentionally has no `review-config.yaml` and no
concept of a maximum loop count. Any default iteration cap is owned by
whatever runtime coordinates repeated invocations, outside this Skill's
package.
